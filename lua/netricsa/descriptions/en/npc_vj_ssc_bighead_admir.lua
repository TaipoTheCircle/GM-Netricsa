DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Cool Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but on the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They spontaneously appear in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Admir Elezovic is one of the key brains behind Croteam. As the project's operator, he oversaw the creation of the very first game in the series, Serious Sam: The First Encounter (2001). His contribution to the franchise's development is invaluable: he was also responsible for the creation and implementation of the series' signature 3D graphics, which were cutting-edge for their time. Admir later contributed to the script for Serious Sam 2 (2005), adding his signature sarcasm and wacky humor to the game.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear a path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy them remotely due to their modifiers.
- In a group cluster, a sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective.
