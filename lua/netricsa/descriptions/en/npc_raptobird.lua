DESCRIPTION:

Raptor-Birds are among the most dangerous predators of the Zenozoic Forest, a dense and teeming region. This forest is known for its exotic trees and plants, which literally fill the entire space, creating ideal conditions for stealthy and swift hunters.

The creature resembles a cross between a chameleon, a bird, and a rodent. Its elongated head is covered in thick, scaly skin, similar in texture to that of a fish. Large eyes with round pupils allow it to instantly detect movement among foliage and shadows. Horn-like projections, curved in semicircles, extend above its head.

The raptor-bird's body is covered in dark scales, in places blending into brown skin. Its coloration ranges from brown and red to dirty white spots, making it almost invisible among the roots, moss, and tree growths of the Forest. Its limbs are slender, with long fingers and sharp claws, ideal for climbing, abrupt leaps, and holding onto prey.

TIPS:

- Forest thickets are its natural habitat, not yours.
- Kicks and strong punches are best against it.
