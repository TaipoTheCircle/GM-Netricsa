AKMS ASSAULT RIFLE


WEAPON: AKMS
AMMO:   7.62x39 mm
ROF:    ~600 rounds / min

DESCRIPTION:

A lightweight folding-stock variant of the AKM designed originally for paratroopers. It serves as a reliable 7.62×39 mm carbine - offering strong close-range stopping power with acceptable mid-range accuracy. Its relatively low cyclic rate for an automatic weapon improves controllability versus higher-rate assault rifles.

NOTES:

- Highly durable and simple to operate.
- Moderate recoil; controllable in short bursts.
- Effective against unarmored and lightly armored targets.
- Magazine capacity requires periodic reloads during prolonged combat.
