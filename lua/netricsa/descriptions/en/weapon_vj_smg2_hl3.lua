SMG2 SUBMACHINE GUN (MP7)


WEAPON: SMG2 SUBMACHINE GUN (MP7)
AMMO:   4,6×30mm.
RR:     ~900 RPM
WEIGHT: 2,0 kg.

DESCRIPTION:

The SMG2 is the standard submachine gun for assault units, used in the early stages of the Unification Conflicts. Designed for the rapid suppression of enemies in densely populated areas and aboard transport hubs.

The high rate of fire ensures concentrated fire and effectively deters numerically superior forces. The weapon is designed for mobile combat and frequent changes of position, sacrificing range for close-range control.

NOTES:

- Optimal for close-quarters combat and clearing corridors
- Effective at suppressing enemy manpower
- Large ammunition capacity makes it a reliable support weapon
- Slightly inferior in accuracy at long ranges compared to long-barreled weapons
