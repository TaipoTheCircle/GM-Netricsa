DESCRIPTION:

These soldiers were once true US Navy SEALs, masters of surprise raids and rescue operations in the world's most dangerous zones.

They operated as part of a team capable of bypassing any security and eliminating a target behind enemy lines, sometimes risking their lives for a few minutes of strategic advantage.

After the Combine occupied Earth, they were recruited into Overwatch, offered the chance to "keep their jobs" and transfer to serve the new "global security" agency.

TIPS:

- They're not kidding - he shoots fast and accurately.
