DESCRIPTION:

The Shpagin 41 submachine gun was developed by Georgy Shpagin during the Great Patriotic War. It was adopted by the Red Army on December 21, 1940, and served Soviet soldiers all the way to Berlin and then in Manchuria. The PPSh-41 is considered a weapon of victory and deservedly has the status of a legendary weapon. This weapon is famous for its high rate of fire and its somewhat unusual appearance. It uses a 71-round drum magazine, which was very inconvenient, and was subsequently replaced with a 35-round sector magazine, which was much more convenient. In the 1960s, it was removed from service in the Soviet Army and replaced with the Kalashnikov assault rifle. But that was not the end of its history. It continued to be used in Cold War conflicts, such as the Korean War (1950-1953), the Indochina War (1946-1954), the Vietnam War (1955-1975), etc. Today, this weapon is owned by many collectors and ordinary weapon enthusiasts, and it is also used in modern wars, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Russian-Ukrainian conflict.
