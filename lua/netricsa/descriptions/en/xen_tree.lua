DESCRIPTION:

The Xen Tree is a hostile, mobile alien tree‐like organism native to Xen and also found in some parts of Black Mesa.

It resembles an inverted root or trunk with a large hooked appendage at its top that functions like a stabbing limb.

Though it appears plantlike and rooted, the trunk is articulated - the tree can sway and extend to strike at prey that moves nearby. When a creature approaches, the Xen Tree violently stabs with its hook‐limb, making it a trap in areas you might pass through unknowingly.

Xen Trees do not consume bodies or feed like animals - they simply attack intruders and then return to idle behavior.

They are often found near Xen's Light Stalk plants and in places where the Xen ecosystem is dense, acting as defensive flora in the alien environment.

TIPS:

- Keep movement minimal near Xen Trees - their stab attack triggers on motion.
- Trick enemies into walking near them so the tree does the killing.
- Melee attacks tend to trigger stabbing faster than normal.
- Normal weapons damage do little - they are extremely resistant to conventional fire.
