BLACK MESA WAREHOUSE, FREIGHT YARD


So, let's recap, Sam.

The blue container turned out to be full of Vortigaunts. The red one, scientists. Logic followed, surprises discovered, trust in color coding completely destroyed.

Another container greets us outside. Of course, it's red. If the system worked once, it definitely needs to be inspected. It's parked on the train, the last hope of exiting this ride. Is Rosenberg in there? It's unknown. But the likelihood is higher than the previous two, and in Black Mesa, that's reason for optimism.

Carefully block the entrance to the container with the mats and reels. Not symbolically, literally. Someone decided the best way to guard it was to place something heavy and nail it down with boards. A plan designed for people who couldn't disrupt the environment for the sake of progress. You, unfortunately, aren't one of them.

The mechanics are simple. You break the boards, and the spools fall. The spools fall, and the passage opens. The laws of physics, unlike the laws of human reason, still apply here.

The sector is guarded by H.E.C.U. soldiers. The same faces, the same rifles, the same certainty that they've passed through here before. In the next room, behind the tablet, stands an Abrams tank. Inside are soldiers. Apparently, they consider the tank a compelling argument with a man who's already lived through the end of the world.

If Rosenberg really is in that container, he's very lucky.

If not, we've simply moved heavy objects again for the sake of morale.

In any case, Sam, the choice is clear.

Break it. Let the spools fall.

The railroad hasn't seen such a passenger in a long time.
