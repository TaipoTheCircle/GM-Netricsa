HALF-QUAKE SHOW, REPEAT 2


The escape is canceled.

Reality has reconsidered.

The show decided you got your taste of freedom too soon. So they rolled back the script, updated the patch, and launched the "No, it's all bullshit, let's start over" mode.

Congratulations, Sam, you've stepped into the rerun's living room with expanded amenities.

Same rooms. Same ideas. But now everything is done with love of detail and hatred for humanity.

The spike trap? Of course, it's back. But now the spikes aren't just coming out of the walls, probably from someone's imagination.

The other "little things" are still there.

New corners where you can fall.

The most evil jokes with life and death.

So watch closely, Sam.

The show loves surprises.

And we are their main content.
