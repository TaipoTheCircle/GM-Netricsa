DESCRIPTION:

The AW50 is a large-caliber anti-materiel/sniper rifle built on the Arctic Warfare platform and chambered in .50 BMG. It’s intended to engage material targets, light armor and distant personnel; the design balances long-range accuracy with rugged field reliability. 

NOTES:

- Role: anti-materiel / long-range sniper - disable equipment, destroy sensitive targets and engage personnel at extended ranges. 
- Fitted with a heavy muzzle brake and bipod; folding stock options improve transportability. 
- Effective engagement range is around 1,500 m (varies with ammunition, sighting and environment); armour-piercing and specialized .50 rounds are commonly used. 
- Considerable mass and length require support (bipod/tripod or team-carried deployment); not suited for agile, close-quarters roles.
