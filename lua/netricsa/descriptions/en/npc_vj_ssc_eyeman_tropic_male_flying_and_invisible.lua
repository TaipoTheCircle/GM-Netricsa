DESCRIPTION:

A small bipedal animal with no head, one eye and a large mouth. Originating from Sirius, and trained by Mental to attack opposing forces. The males are smaller, purple and not as tough as females.

The tropical variant is considered one of the most primitive branches of the gnaar species — their tribal development effectively stalled at this point. They never advanced beyond rudimentary clan structures and remain locked into simple, combat-oriented social behavior.

TIPS:

- They have no ranged weapons, just keep away.
- Some specimens can levitate.
- Rare individuals have reportedly been invisible.
- The tropical subspecies never progressed beyond an early tribal stage, making their behavior primitive and highly predictable.
