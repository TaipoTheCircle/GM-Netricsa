HALF-QUAKE SHOW, REPEAT


Of course.

Repeat. Because if the audience liked it, then they have to do the same thing. Only worse.

We're back where we were before. The same walls, the familiar outlines, the sense of déjà vu that's considered part of the design here. But now everything is "improved." The lava no longer offers a choice of three slabs. Instead, there's a single rotating platform. It spins confidently, without hesitation, as if it knows that equilibrium is temporary.

There are more spikes behind the lava. Noticeably more. The organizers clearly decided you were moving too confidently last time. They're fixing it.

The elevator is gone. It's been removed. Replaced with another passage. Where it leads is still unclear.

Mental's troops, of course, are still there. They've also received an upgrade. New positions, more aggression, less patience. They like it when the scenario repeats itself, but the outcome is still uncertain.

They're testing how well you can handle pain.

How quickly you adapt.

And how much you disappoint them.
