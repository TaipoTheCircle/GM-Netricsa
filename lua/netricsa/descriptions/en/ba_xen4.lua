THE FRONTIER WORLD OF XEN, WATERFALLS OF XEN


Sam, stop for a second. Yes, right now.

I've detected the device. The signal is clear. Reliable. Unmistakable. I could swear on my neurons that this is it. The one. Teleportation control. The final piece of the puzzle.

It's just a little bit closer. On a Xen scale, it's almost there. On a survival scale, it's the same as always.

Between us and the goal lie caves with waterfalls.

But we're close, Sam. So close that even Xen seems to be getting nervous. The space is distorting more, the signals are more stable, and the resistance is more desperate.

Go through the caves.

Don't lose your bearings.

If I'm wrong, you can chalk it up to interference.

But if I'm right...

then we'll soon have a chance to escape from here.
