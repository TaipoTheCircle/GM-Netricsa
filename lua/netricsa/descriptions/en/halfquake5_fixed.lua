HALF-QUAKE SHOW, HEAVEN AND AMBUSH


It seems the Sadists are having trouble with expectations.

Sam is still alive. The statistics are crying, the script is nervously smoking on the sidelines, and the announcer is pretending it was meant to be.

There's an elevator ahead. It kindly invites you to continue. And yes, it leads straight into an ambush.

They're already waiting at the top.

Vortigaunts and Headcrabs, marked ">)".

To open the passage further, you need to activate two buttons. Left and right. Classic.

This is the moment where the show is counting on panic.

But the Sadist is already surprised.

Which means it's time to surprise him again.

Buttons and a door.

And a bunch of people who are sure you came here to lose.
