DESCRIPTION:

An executed Syrian soldier, raised from the dead by Mental and remotely controlled by a Life Control Unit (LCU).

He no longer needs a head: there's nothing to think with and nothing to do. His task is simple: cut everything while his saws' motors are spinning.

After decapitation, his nervous system was crudely rewired via the LCU, and his hands are now firmly attached to his chainsaws.

When a Chainsawer detects a target, it accelerates sharply, as if someone had just turned the throttle all the way to the floor, making it nearly impossible to escape.

Groups of Chainsawer are especially dangerous. When grouped together, they transform into a moving tornado of blades, blood, and the screeching of engines—a veritable hurricane of death that crushes everything in its path, including cover and Mental's allies.

TIPS:

- Extremely dangerous due to its stupidity. Never let it get close.
- The best choice is a double-barreled shotgun or a rocket launcher.
- In a group, they form a hailstorm of deadly violence.
