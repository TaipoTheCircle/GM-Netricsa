DESCRIPTION:

The MP-7 submachine gun is a submachine gun developed in the early 2000s by the German company Heckler & Koch. It is an automatic weapon chambered for the specially designed 4.6×30 mm cartridge. The MP7 is designed as a small submachine gun with a magazine inserted into the pistol grip, a folding telescopic stock, and a folding auxiliary grip at the front. The MP7's automatic mechanism is based on a gas engine with a short-stroke gas piston, and the bolt is locked by turning the slide. The design incorporates some features of the HK G36 assault rifle, such as the extensive use of polymer materials, similar automatic mechanism, and trigger mechanism design. It was used in the Afghan War, is also used by law enforcement agencies in NATO countries, and is used by criminals.

NOTES:

- Compact and lightweight.
- The stock and tactical grip can be folded.
- It can be modified by adding a sight or laser sight.
