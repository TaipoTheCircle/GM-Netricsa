DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam's developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Sean "mwadaibe" Center is another key cog in the legendary modding collective A Few Screws Loose, whose work has been officially recognized and forever etched into the series' lore. His exaggerated cranium is a testament to his deep understanding of balance, flow design, and the pure, unbridled dynamics of online battles. Together with the team, he worked on the renowned Seriously Warped Deathmatch mod for The Second Encounter, creating and refining those 20 insane maps that inspired a whole generation of Serious Sam esports players.

His contribution goes beyond mere fan art: it was a full-fledged collaborative project, where the community's passion met the studio's trust. Sean and his colleagues didn't just give the game additional content - ​​they extended its lifespan, established its cult status in multiplayer, and proved that the most brilliant ideas can be born at the intersection of professional development and fan devotion.

He was once alive, but after someone killed him, he was resurrected - becoming an Angel.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, eliminate them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
