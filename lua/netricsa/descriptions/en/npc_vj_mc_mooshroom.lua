DESCRIPTION:

Cows are peaceful herbivores that inhabit the plains, meadows, and hills of the Minecraft world. They graze on green grass, never attack, and behave calmly.

In the wild, cows are often found in groups. Their rhythmic mooing and massive bodies create the feeling of a stable and vibrant ecosystem.

Cows can be milked from a bucket without causing harm, making them a reliable source of milk while traveling.

TIPS:

- Cow's milk is your best friend when poisoned or suffering from bad potion effects.
- Beef provides health and satiety.
- Place cows in a pen for a constant supply of resources.
