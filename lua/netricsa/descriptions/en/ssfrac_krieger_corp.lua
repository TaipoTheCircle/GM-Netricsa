KRIEGER CORPORATION


Krieger Comporation is a private corporation led by Dr. George Wilhelm Krieger, conducting illegal genetic research on a remote tropical archipelago in the Pacific Ocean. Their goal is to transform any living being into something "superior," beyond moral and biological boundaries.

Forgotten jungles and abandoned military fortifications have become a witness-less laboratory. Krieger rejected humanity as weakness, believing that the true future lies in radical evolution, which he champions.

Under his auspices, experiments are conducted on humans and primates using the mutant serum "Trigen". The result is aggressive, mindless creatures-Trigens-whose rage and physical prowess exceed all expectations, but whose devotion to science has devolved into chaos.

The company's security is provided by Krieger's mercenaries-brutal warriors from all over the world, willing to kill on command, no questions asked. Their commanders kept their soldiers on edge, and their weapons and tactics made the archipelago nearly impregnable.
