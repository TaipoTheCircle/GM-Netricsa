DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Overwatch Medic is a specialized battlefield support unit, visually distinguished from standard soldiers by their white armor with orange medical insignia and yellow visor lenses.

Unlike regular infantry, Medics are tasked with keeping Overwatch squads in fighting condition during prolonged engagements. Equipped with bioscanners and portable healing injectors, they can rapidly stabilize wounded soldiers, administer Combine-made stimulants, and extend the combat endurance of entire units.

Though primarily support-oriented, they remain heavily armed and will not hesitate to engage enemies directly if threatened. Their presence ensures that Combine squads are much harder to eliminate, often forcing resistance fighters into drawn-out firefights.

TIPS:

- Target Medics first - their healing will prolong battles significantly.
- Watch for him -  every a wounded Combine Soldier may suddenly recover to full strength.
