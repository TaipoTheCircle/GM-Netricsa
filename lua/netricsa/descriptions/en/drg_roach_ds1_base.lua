DESCRIPTION:

Hailing from Lordran, the land of Gwyn, Andre worked passionately at an old, run-down church in the Undead Parish. From there, he served as a blacksmith, providing smithing and repairs to any travelers who needed it. 

Andre boasts a stocky but muscular build, with so much PERCEPTION to the point that he doesn't even bother with wearing a shirt. While most blacksmiths would typically fight with their hammer, Andre instead uses his hands and god-given strength to pulverize any poor soul who dares to challenge him. Basically, use your common fucking sense and don't even think about opposing this behemoth of a man.


TIPS:

- ALWAYS stay on his good side, otherwise the consequences may be fatal.
- Never lower your guard when fighting Andre; His punches are not to be reckoned with.
- If he starts to recklessly charge, GET OUT OF THE WAY! He has a nasty dropkick...
