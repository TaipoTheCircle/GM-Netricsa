THE ZIXIE ALLIANCE 


The Zixie are an ancient and peaceful race living on the planet Magnor, high among the giant trees, where their cities are intertwined with vines, ropes, and wooden platforms. Their society is based on harmony with nature, belief in the spirits of the forest, and respect for life in all its forms.

Despite their outward appearance and simplicity, the Zixie possess remarkable engineering skills. They create complex lifting mechanisms, defensive turrets, and energy weapons, which they use only in extreme cases-when their home is threatened with destruction.

When Mental's Horde invaded Magnor, the Zixie did not retreat. They stood up to defend their world, uniting with the Alliance to maintain the balance of life in the universe.
