BLACK MESA, M1 ABRAMS


Uhhhhh, crawling through pipes to reach the surface wasn't exactly glamorous, but hey - sunlight! Or at least what passes for it through the Black Mesa dust storms. For a second I thought we'd get a breather up here... then I noticed the welcoming committee. And by committee, I mean a whole division of H.E.C.U. soldiers spread across the plateau, plus one shiny M1 Abrams tank parked right in the middle like it owns the place.

But listen to this: while we were underground, I intercepted some encrypted chatter from the H.E.C.U. command net. Guess what? They don't actually know what they're fighting. They think the alien invasion is "containable" and that you're just a rogue element making things worse. Which means congratulations - you've officially been promoted from "scientist's assistan" to "priority target".

Recommendation? Don't try to argue with them, because diplomacy usually doesn't work when the other side has 120mm cannons. Instead, do what you do best: run, shoot, dodge, and make them wonder why they ever signed up for this mission in the first place.

But... (yes, there's always a but) - defeating this force isn't the real challenge. Surviving long enough to figure out where the next corridor leads is. And considering the size of the guns they've brought to stop you... well, let's just say this "surface" might be even deadlier than the underground.
