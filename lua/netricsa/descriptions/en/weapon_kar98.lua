DESCRIPTION:

The Mauser 98k carbine is a German bolt-action rifle from World War II, officially adopted by the German army in 1935. The Kar98k was the most common rifle in the German army during World War II. It was mainly used by regular soldiers and snipers. It has a 5-round magazine and was loaded either with 5-round clips or one round at a time by hand (if no clip was available). This rifle also has a ZF 39 sniper scope, which is mounted above the bolt, thereby blocking reloading with clips, leaving soldiers to load the rifle one round at a time. This rifle also has an SG 84/98 bayonet knife. This bayonet had a 25 cm blade and a total length of 38.5 cm. Large-scale bayonet fighting was not typical of World War II, so in order to save money, from the end of 1944, rifles were no longer equipped with bayonet knives, and they did not even have a bayonet mount or ramrod. In addition to the standard bayonet, the SG 42 model was adopted for service, although it did not go into production. The SG 42 was 30 cm long with a blade length of 17.6 cm.

NOTES:

- Try to shoot from a distance, because it can be very difficult to kill an enemy with this rifle at close range. It is better to use a bayonet knife or your backup weapon.
- Load the rifle with clips, it's much faster than loading one cartridge at a time by hand.
- Change your position often after firing so that the enemy doesn't notice you.
