BLACK MESA, THE SECURITY TRAIN


Listen, we've been teleported back to the past again... And now you're Sam the guard! Do you want to ask "Why?" "You're in the security train. What a disguise you have - in these clothes you look like... let's just say a non-standard employee of Black Mesa. But while scientists are staring at the flag and helicopters are circling overhead, you're being given a chance to pass unnoticed.

There are rocks all around, a suspicious ball, and silence, broken only by the sound of a nearby helicopter. Above, somewhere behind the glass, military turntables are cutting circles. Can you feel it? The air is buzzing with tension. Somewhere, another Sam is already stepping into the test chamber - soon everything will blow up here. But for now... For now, it's just a trip.

Look around: the scientists are chatting, the guard at the flag is bored. Everything looks casual. It's too casual. We know these "calm" moments - they always end with something.

Keep your hand on your holster. Even if it's quiet now, tomorrow it may crash so that this car will seem like a children's carousel.

Go ahead, "guard". For now, you can just go.
