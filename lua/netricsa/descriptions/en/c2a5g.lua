BLACK MESA: ARTILLERY GROUNDS


The tunnel was supposed to be cover. Instead, it was a cage - and inside it waited a full-grown Gargantua. No half-measures this time. The entire passage trembled under its weight, every step echoing like thunder down the concrete throat. Retreat wasn't optional. Survival meant sprinting for daylight.

Breaking into the open doesn't bring relief - it brings artillery. An emplacement looms in the center of a wrecked courtyard, its barrel still warm, smoke curling from the last shell it fired.

And the man behind it? Found him. Or what's left of him. Commander Luther - the officer who once leveled this same gun against you during the Osprey ambush. Now he's nothing but a broken uniform sprawled against the base of the cannon, body torn in the chaos he helped unleash.
