ROF:         ~600 rounds/min

DESCRIPTION:

Assembled somewhere in the basements of separatists in Chechnya or somewhere in the US by a local sociopath, a Kalashnikov remains a Kalashnikov. It fires 7.62 mm caliber cartridges. It is effective at medium ranges and capable of sustained fire for suppression or direct engagement. 

NOTES:

- High durability and ease of use.
- Moderate recoil; controllable in short bursts.
- Effective against unarmored and lightly armored targets.
- Magazine capacity requires periodic reloading during prolonged combat.
- Clearly unreliable design.
