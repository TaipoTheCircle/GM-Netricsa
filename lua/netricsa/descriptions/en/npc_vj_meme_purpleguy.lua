DESCRIPTION:

William Afton is a serial killer of Alliance soldiers, a being who long ago ceased to be merely human. He once wore an Overwatch Elite suit, but it was purple, distinguishing him even among the Elite. Along with Wallace Breen, Afton was at the forefront of the Citadel's cafeteria brand, working in a variety of positions across Alliance establishments. Behind the façade of "service", Afton hid a predator, methodically studying the weaknesses of those around him.

Over time, the enraged spirits of his victims trapped Afton within his own suit, turning the armor into both a prison and a sarcophagus. From that moment on, he became a living massacre. His blood is purple, and his body displays an abnormal vitality, as if he had already partially crossed the line between life and death.

Afton is a pronounced sociopath. His narcissism permeates his every action, fueling his manipulative nature. He doesn't just kill-he dominates. Skillfully targeting vulnerable spots, Afton lures Alliance soldiers into isolated rooms where he executes them in private. He revels in the pain of those around him, turning fear into a tool.

Deep down, Afton understands his own worthlessness, but compensates for this with a distorted sense of grandeur, exaggerating the achievements of others and claiming them for himself. He is obsessed with science and technological advances, seeing them as the path to his cherished goal - immortality. A religious fear of hell makes him even more cruel: Afton wants to live forever, at any cost.

In combat, he uses every weapon available, varying his style from methodical suppression to bloody close combat. He takes his time. He plays.

TIPS:

- Never be alone with him - that's exactly what he wants.
- High survivability makes it unlikely that he'll be killed quickly.
- Dangerous at any range.
