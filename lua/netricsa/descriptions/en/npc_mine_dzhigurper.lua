DESCRIPTION:

This creeper isn't just an explosive mob from the Minecraft Overworld. No, it's possessed by Nikita Dzigurda himself, making it an extremely... emotional creature. It creeps up on you, emitting terrifying screams.

When Dzigurda Creeper explodes, its body disintegrates into a multitude of miniature Dzigurda faces, which continue to scream.

TIPS:

- Don't stand too close—the explosion not only deals damage but can also stun.
- Trying to move too slowly will result in... Dzhigurda screaming.
- If you have noise-canceling headphones, put them on immediately.
