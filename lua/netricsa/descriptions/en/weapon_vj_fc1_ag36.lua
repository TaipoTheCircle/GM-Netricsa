DESCRIPTION:

The G36 + AG36 package is a modern assault rifle platform fitted with a 40-mm underbarrel grenade launcher. The G36 delivers reliable automatic and semi-automatic fire with good controllability and accuracy at intermediate ranges. The AG36 adds explosive area effect for clearing cover, denying space, or engaging light vehicles - all without switching primary weapons.

NOTES:

- Versatile loadout: precision/suppressive rifle fire (G36) combined with area explosive capability (AG36).
- AG36 fires an arcing projectile - account for drop at medium/long ranges.
- Beware of self-damage in confined spaces when firing grenades; use from cover.
- Modular mounting allows quick removal of AG36 to revert to standalone rifle operation.
- Optics often include markings or aiming solutions for the grenade launcher to aid 50-400 m engagements.
