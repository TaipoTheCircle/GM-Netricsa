DESCRIPTION:

An executed Sirian soldier, raised from the dead by Mental and remote controlled by Life Control Unit (LCU). 

The Kamikaze's head is crushed, making it prone to suicidal attacks. It carries a bomb in each hand, which it detonates when it gets close enough to its target.

Inspired by the success of its shrinking experiments, Mental applied the same technology to the Kamikaze. Now, micro-kamikazes race across the world—nearly invisible due to their size, but carrying equally powerful bombs in their tiny hands. They are nearly impossible to notice until they are dangerously close.

TIPS:

- Explodes immediately upon death.
- Any suspicious rustling or movement nearby is a reason to jump back.
