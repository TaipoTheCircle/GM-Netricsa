DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Peter Kleiner is an unrivaled master of one of the most subtle yet crucial disciplines in game graphics: skybox art. His exaggerated skull is a perfectly calibrated sphere within which entire skies, clouds, distant mountain ranges, and star clusters are born. It is his work that creates the epic backdrop that transforms the endless battlefields in The Second Encounter into part of a vast, living world, and not just a shooting arena.

Peter's career bridges eras and genres: from the iconic Spyro the Dragon (1998) to his remastered Reignited Trilogy (2018), and, of course, through the entire classic and HD Serious Sam series. His skyboxes aren't just backdrops, but full-fledged atmospheric narratives that set the tone for the adventure, whether it's a fairytale world of dragons or an apocalyptic wasteland overrun by Mental.

He was once alive, but after someone killed him, he was resurrected - becoming an Angel.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
