DESCRIPTION:

Clementine is a 17-year-old girl who has survived almost her entire life in a zombie apocalypse. Her parents turned undead when she was 8, so a man named Lee looked after her. Lee became Clementine's best friend, but unfortunately, he too died. He was bitten, and Clementine had to shoot him. This moment remains deeply etched in Clementine's mind. She then survived with other survivors from her group, Omid and Christa, but they also died. Clementine then found other groups, but they all fell apart and died. From one group, Clementine managed to save a baby named Alvin Jr., and he became someone she could live and fight for. But he disappeared. Clementine thought he was dead, but then learned he was alive, and she went looking for him. Thanks to Javvi Garcia, she was able to find out where AJ was and went to save him. She managed to save him, but she massacred the place where the baby was being cared for. She didn't know these people were kind and killed them, which left AJ with mental trauma. Clementine and AJ wandered alone for a long time and survived, but then they found the Erickson School for Troubled Teens, where they made new friends and a new home. But they had to fight for it. Raiders wanted to steal children from the school and train them as soldiers. Then Clementine didn't lose her composure and took command. She devised a defense plan, and they were able to repel the Raider attack, but still suffered losses. Their friends were kidnapped, and then Clementine decided to save them. They devised a plan, and with the help of a new acquaintance, James (who was a pacifist even toward walkers), they were able to break into the Raider base alive. With the help of walkers James gave them, they freed their friends and destroyed their base. But as they were running, Clementine was bitten on the leg. AJ didn't want to accept it; it was so painful to admit that the woman who had cared for him all her life, just like his own mother, could die. Clementine asked AJ to kill her, but the boy refused to give in. He took an axe and chopped off Clementine's infected limb, thereby saving her from zombification. Afterwards, he administered first aid and dragged her to school, where the other children helped her recover. And after all the horror they had been through together, they finally found a home and began to live happily ever after.

TIPS:

- I don't recommend shooting her. She's very kind and friendly, but if someone attempts to harm her or her loved ones, she becomes a cold-blooded killer.
- Clementine can give you ammo or first aid kits; she's a very good ally in battle.
- She can regenerate her health (using first aid kits).
