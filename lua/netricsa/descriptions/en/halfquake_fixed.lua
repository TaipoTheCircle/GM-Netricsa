HALF-QUAKE SHOW, UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES


...Now that's interesting, Sam.

The portal worked. Earth. Gravity is familiar. But there's no hint of Black Mesa here. It smells of spectacle, though.

Welcome to Half-Quake. A sadistic show where pain is presented as entertainment and survival is considered bad form. Judging by the announcer's opening monologue, three stages of "tests" await us. He, of course, meant torture.

The show has long been avid buyer of Black Mesa equipment. Turrets, Xen-like creatures, experimental hardware. Anything that can be used to inflict suffering and elicit applause. Someone clearly decided that disaster is a business opportunity.

Look around.

Behind you is a large button with a ">)" symbol. It looks like an invitation. There's a door ahead. It's locked for now. The cage you're standing in is waiting for the signal. They want you to be nervous. To wait. To suffer in advance.

And the announcer also said the following:

"We're not here to save the world." Freeman, he said, is already doing that. Or, more accurately, the first Sam.

And you're here for something else.

You're here to suffer.

For "a huge mistake in your life." They don't specify what exactly. Apparently, the show's format doesn't allow for details. Perhaps for existing at all. Or for exterminating Xen creatures and seriously intending to finish off Mental, instead of dying beautifully according to the script.

Bad news: the show is built on that.

Good news: they chose the wrong contestant.

There's one more nuance. Mental has already made a deal with the organizers. His troops are now part of the program. Officially. With the goal of "finishing Sam once and for all." It's good to know you have a stable reputation.

So here's my advice, Sam.

They want suffering—give it to them.

But not your own.
