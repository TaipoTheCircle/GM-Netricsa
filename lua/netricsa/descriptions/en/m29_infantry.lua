M29 INFANTRY ASSAULT RIFLE


WEAPON: M29 Infantry Assault Rifle
AMMO:   5.56 mm tungsten-flechette rounds.
ROF:    up to 600 RPM.

DESCRIPTION:

The EDFâ€™s standard-issue assault rifle - a rugged, mass-produced hybrid design using a gas-operated, rotating-bolt mechanism. Fitted with an elongated barrel for extended range and a reflex sight for fast target acquisition. Hip-fire produces wide spread; aiming down sights yields high accuracy.

NOTES:

- Low recoil, good accuracy when sighted - ideal for medium to long engagements. 
- Single shot per press, hold for continuous fire; ADS greatly improves grouping.
