DESCRIPTION:

A holy warrior from a primitive race evolved from arthropods. Extremely hostile due to their religious convictions.
Carries a chaingun with ammo-replenisher in one hand. Exoskeleton covers entire Arachnoid's body and provides good protection against bullets, explosives and fire.
The Elders are incredibly rare since only a few Arachnoids can survive this long, and due to this, they are incredibly strong. They have a strong, but withered, rusted exoskeleton and a much larger size than the Adults.

TIPS:

- Dangerous sting - do not approach too closely.
- Will shoot through their own ranks in fury.
