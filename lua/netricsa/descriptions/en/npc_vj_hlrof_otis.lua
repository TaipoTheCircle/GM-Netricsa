DESCRIPTION:

Otis is a Black Mesa security guard, often as lazy, distracted, and slow to react. Despite his clumsiness, he is equipped with a powerful Desert Eagle, which makes him surprisingly dangerous in close-range firefights.

Unlike standard guards, Otis is more of a comic-relief figure in the chaos of Black Mesa. His poor fitness limits his effectiveness, but his willingness to help and his strong sidearm keep him useful as a defensive ally.

TIPS:

- Protect him - his Desert Eagle a punch, but his ENDURANCE is low.
- Don't rely on him for long chases or heavy combat.
- Keep enemies at a distance where he can safely shoot.
