XEN, ABANDONED CAPSULE BAY


This...  isn't on the map. The capsule bays here are dead - literally. Pods are cracked, fluids dried up, sparks popping from broken conduits. Whatever was incubating here either escaped centuries ago or turned to dust. No controllers, no guards, no hissing Vortigaunts lurking in corners.

Even the “buttons” on the colums - if you can call pulsating lumps of tissue buttons - aren't responding. Lights are out. Systems are silent. This whole section feels like a mausoleum for a war factory that lost interest.

Mental's forces  like shadows sniffing around an empty fridge. They're just... curious.

Recommendation: don't waste your time. There's nothing left to salvage or smash. Turn back, retrace your steps, and head for the Nihilanth's portal. That's where the action - and the way forward - actually is.
