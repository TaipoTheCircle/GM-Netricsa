DESCRIPTION:

These soldiers were once true US Navy SEALs, masters of surprise raids and rescue operations in the world's most dangerous zones.

They operated as part of a team capable of bypassing any security and eliminating a target behind enemy lines, sometimes risking their lives for a few minutes of strategic advantage.

This soldier was originally an assault expert for SEALTeam 6, responsible for clearing buildings, raiding fortified installations, and working in tight corridors.

He loved loud solutions-a shotgun was his best friend.

After transferring to the Combine, he was given a brown close-combat suit and an orange helmet to visually distinguish him from standard Overwatch soldiers.

TIPS:

- They're not kidding-he shoots fast and accurately.
