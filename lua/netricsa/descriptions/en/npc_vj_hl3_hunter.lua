DESCRIPTION:

The Ministrider is an early concept and prototype of the Hunter developed by the Combine.

In appearance, the Ministrider resembles a smaller, but no less menacing Hunter - it stands on three legs, has mechanical bladed arms, and is capable of automatic attacks. It fires pulsed energy blasts, making it dangerous to kill even from a distance.

The Ministerrider not only pursues its target but can also exploit its surroundings, react quickly to threats, and engage in aggressive combat in open areas.

TIPS:

- The Ministerrider's pulse volleys work at medium range—cover and repositioning reduce the danger.
- Its blades are deadly in close combat-avoid contact.
- Unlike the Hunter, it possesses super-speed.
