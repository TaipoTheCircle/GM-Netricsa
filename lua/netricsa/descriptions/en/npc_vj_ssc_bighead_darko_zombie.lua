DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but on the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They spontaneously appear in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Darko Martinovic is one of the key programmers who pioneered the series' gameplay mechanics. His oversized skull is a direct result of his deep immersion in the code, creating that "serious" chaos onscreen. While the names of leading developers are often household names, it's specialists like Darko who form the foundation upon which the gameplay is built.

His contribution to the series is particularly noticeable in two landmark projects: Serious Sam: The Second Encounter (2001) and Serious Sam II (2005). In these games, he worked on critical aspects—from optimizing the countless enemies on screen to implementing the responsive controls that have become the franchise's hallmark. Darko is a typical example of the "invisible genius" of game development, whose work remains in the shadows, yet without whom the signature dynamics and flawlessness for which players so appreciate Serious Sam would not be possible.

He was once alive, but after someone killed him, he rose from the dead - becoming a demonic Zombie.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear a path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy them remotely due to their modifiers.
- In a group cluster, a sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective.
