DESCRIPTION:

The Light Stalk is one of the characteristic organisms of Xen -  stalks with radiant cores that glow in the dark. These plants provide ambient light across the floating islands of Xen. 

While primarily passive, these stems can defend themselves: when attacked, they hide out. They seem intertwined with Xen's ecosystem, often found near Xen Trees and other alien flora, forming natural landmarks in the hostile terrain.

TIPS:

- Use Light Stalk as beacons in dark Xen caverns.
- They often cluster around Xen Tree groves - watch for ambushes.
