DESCRIPTION:

Security Guard Barniel is part of Black Mesa Security and is responsible for protecting researchers, equipment, and sensitive areas of the facility. Despite similar training and equipment to male security guards, she often patrols corridors, labs, and maintenance areas, requiring flexibility and quick response.

During the Resonance Cascade, female security guards demonstrated adaptability and teamwork, helping evacuate scientists, protect critical facilities, and coordinate with other personnel. Despite their lack of heavy armor, they are trained to engage hostile Xen creatures and intruders, making them valuable in the early stages of containment and defense operations.

TIPS:

- Protect them whenever possible - they can assist in escort missions.
- They are vulnerable to powerful attacks, so it's crucial to keep them out of direct fire.
- Monitor their patrol routes; they can point out key points or safe routes.
