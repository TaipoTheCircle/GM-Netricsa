DESCRIPTION:

These soldiers were once true US Navy SEALs, masters of surprise raids and rescue operations in the world's most dangerous hotspots.

They operated as part of a team capable of bypassing any security and eliminating a target behind enemy lines, sometimes risking their lives for a few minutes of strategic advantage.

These fighters previously conducted hostage rescue operations and the neutralization of dangerous prisoners.

They were specialists in assaults and safe evacuations until they fell under the influence of the Combine.

Now they serve Overwatch, operating within the Nova Prospekt prison fortifications.

TIPS:

- Their skills are especially dangerous in confined spaces.
