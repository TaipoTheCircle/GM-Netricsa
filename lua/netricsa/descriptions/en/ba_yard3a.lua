BLACK MESA WAREHOUSE, SUSPICIOUS SUITCASE WITH TOOLS


Sam, you're in the Black Mesa warehouse-and it's not a spare parts warehouse, it's a real menagerie!

Vortigaunts are swarming around.

And somewhere in the corners, headcrabs rustle.

The focus is on the construction ladder. Next to her is a suitcase with tools. 

At first glance, it is an ordinary proletarian subject. But something is wrong.

It's not just a suitcase...

It's A MONSTER GENERIC.

Examine the suitcase. If you decide to approach, do it slowly.
