DESCRIPTION:

A homemade flamethrower. Created by combining a bicycle pump, a gasoline can, and flares. It consumes ammunition quickly, but proves very useful against monsters vulnerable to fire. This experimental weapon uses gasoline to create a powerful flame. The flamethrower is very effective against large concentrations of enemy troops (both living and non-living), with a stream of flame reaching even those hiding. The fact that they will continue to burn for a few seconds before dying only enhances the effect. Some call this type of weapon "set it and forget it."

NOTES:

- Effective against large concentrations of enemy troops
