DESCRIPTION:

Kolyvan is a noble and wealthy merchant from the times of Kievan Rus, a man who managed to lose literally everything, including himself. In yet another gambling gamble, he put his own freedom on the line-and, of course, lost. His opponent was Mental. Thus, Kolyvan became part of Mental's Horde, the first merchant in history to sell his soul directly.

While retaining his outward appearance-his height, plumpness, long-sleeved green robes, red boots, and cap-Kolyvan's inner being changed little. Greed, cunning, and cowardice remained, but now reinforced by an alien power. As a reward for his service, Mental endowed him with rocket launchers and the ability to summon two Sirian werebulls. This ability is activated strictly by a voice command, pronounced with particular pathos:

"And now, Hunchback!"

Mental promised Kolyvan a generous reward: for his assistance in eliminating Sam Stone, Mental would assist in the massacre of the other heroes. This prospect warms Kolyvan's merchant heart more than gold, for he values ​​personal scores almost as highly as profit.

ADVICE:

- Heard the phrase about Hunchback? Get ready for the bulls.
- Take revenge on everyone who owes him 40,000.
