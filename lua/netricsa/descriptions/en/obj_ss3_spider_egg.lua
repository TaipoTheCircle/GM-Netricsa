DESCRIPTION:

An organic structure that serves as an incubator for a single Antaresian Spider. It consists of a network of strong, sinewy bioroots that anchor it to surfaces-most often ceilings, floors, or walls in places where the spiders feel safe (caves, basements, abandoned tunnels). The cocoon does not attack. When destroyed (by a shot, explosion, or impact), a spider bursts out and immediately attacks the intruder.

TIPS:

- After destruction, be prepared for an immediate spider attack. Take a favorable position beforehand.
