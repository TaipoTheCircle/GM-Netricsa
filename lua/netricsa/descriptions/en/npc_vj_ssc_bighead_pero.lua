DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they receive fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Damir Perovic is one of the four pillars on which the entire Croteam empire rests. His oversized skull contains not only the developer's brain, but also the very idea, the germ of the studio, which arose back in 1989 as part of a school team making the 2D side-scroller "Kids." Along with three classmates, he rose from students at Zagreb's Nikola Tesla School to co-founders of one of Croatia's most iconic game studios.

While the other co-founders became the public faces of the company, Damir remained in the shadows, serving as a support artist and additional programmer in the early stages. His contribution is fundamental: he was there when Croteam was born in an ordinary apartment, establishing the principles of camaraderie and passion that have enabled the studio to survive decades and create the worlds of Serious Sam and The Talos Principle. His presence among the Croteamers is a tribute to their very origins, to the quiet genius whose work in the shadows laid the foundation for all the loud and insane chaos that followed.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, eliminate them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
