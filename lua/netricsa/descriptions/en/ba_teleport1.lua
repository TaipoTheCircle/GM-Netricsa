PROTOTYPE LABS, SECTION A-17


Here we are, Sam. The place where Black Mesa first decided that distance was a guideline, not a rule.

This is where the very first teleportation experiments were conducted. Before the Lambda Sector. Before the resonance cascade. Before the word "experiment" became synonymous with "evacuation." In one of the halls, you can still find an old teleporter prototype. It looks tired. Just like everyone who worked with it.

Rosenberg and his team-Walter Bennett, Simmons, and Harold-tried to activate this device to escape the complex. Not heroically. Practically. Because when Black Mesa starts to crumble, the smartest ones always look for a way out, not an explanation.

Section A-17, also known as the "Old Lab," is the direct predecessor of the Lambda Complex in Sector F. Here, Black Mesa employees built the first teleportation systems to and from Xen. Without guarantees. Without instructions. But with great enthusiasm and a modicum of common sense.

A special zone was created on Xen that allowed travel within a single dimension. Possibly using technology later dubbed the Xen Relay. The device is simple in description and terrifying in its results: you teleport to Xen... and return to Earth in a different place. Or in a different time. Or not quite yourself.
