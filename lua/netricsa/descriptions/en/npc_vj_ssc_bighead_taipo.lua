DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of the developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Taipo never worked for Croteam. Taipo is a Remixer, Physicist, Modder, Beatmaker, Beginner Modeler, Spriter, Developer, Administrator of several Discord servers, Mapper, and Channel Owner. This is not a list of roles, but a single essence of the Creator, which can be limited to a single discipline. His consciousness is constantly in a state of creative synthesis, where the rhythm of FL Studio flows into the logic of a script, and an idea from the abandoned Undertale White finds its way into the localization of the Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy DLC - Escape: Yavin IV Lost Maps.

His journey is a story of overcoming. School. He entered his classroom on September 1st with the naive expectation of friendship, like everyone else. His first social gesture was an outstretched hand. The answer was a punch in the face. That moment became the cornerstone of his reality: the world responds with pain to openness. Thus began a daily life of survival. The money extorted from him around the corner was only a small tribute. Humiliation was the main currency, and isolation the primary tactic. He became like Abby from "Fundamental Paper Education" - fragile, whom the world sought to tear apart simply because he existed.

There were glimmers of hope. A single friend whose name echoed his own. Someone with whom he could be silent, and that silence was comfortable. But one day, that friend disappeared. Without a trace. Searches led only to dead ends, leaving behind not a hole in his schedule, but a crack in reality itself. Proof that connection was possible, whether he lived or died, was annihilated, leaving only a ghostly nostalgia.

There was also a girl who seemed to "see a person in him." Hope flickered in her gaze. But one day, when she returned, she passed by without returning his timid "hello." That icy gaze, devoid of recognition, cut deeper than physical wounds-it was a betrayal of the very idea of ​​humanity. Even those he considered allies turned out to be silent observers of his disintegration.

Family was everything to him. He had no friends in the yard. School became a place he dreaded, and fear became his constant companion, a physiological state, the background noise of life. His school years, marked by bullying and loneliness until 10th grade, did not break him, but redirected his energy inward-into worlds of creativity. He sought real-life friends, but found camaraderie and acceptance in communities like GameBanana and the SVD4LD♬ Discord server, where he rose from a simple assistant with bots to the Chief Administrator of "Creative Glade." His dream of publishing an add-on on Steam Workshop, which he wrote about to Santa Claus, was to be allowed to do so: "I want to be able to publish an add-on on the Steam Workshop." This plea for the chance to show that he was not a nobody, that he, too, deserved to live like everyone else, materialized in 2025 in the form of "Watermelon Thief." This is not just an add-on-it is a symbol of perseverance triumphing over technical barriers.

The first remixes in Synthesia evolved into professional arrangements in FL Studio. Here, amid the boundless possibilities of the Source engine, an old shadow overtook him. He was hatching the idea for a grandiose add-on, "Serious Sam Classic Trilogy," dreaming of bringing epic chaos to the GMod sandbox. But he was beaten to it by someone named Jack-a Blender and code virtuoso who created exactly what Type had dreamed of. His first reaction was bitterness, a sleepless night, the feeling that the world had once again taken something from him. But in this bitterness, a spark was born. "No one has made Netricsa yet!" it dawned on him. An idea no one could steal. He wrote to Jack. And instead of hostility or envy, he found a best friend. Later, S-199 Smirnof taught him how to fix textures. This ability to find his unique niche, learn from others (like Jack and S-199 Smirnof), and immediately apply that knowledge is his superpower.

His Tribes fandom was deleted, his channels abandoned, his projects frozen, but each one is a brick in the bridge of his creative journey. He's not just a consumer of content-he's an archivist, translator, and adapter, reviving forgotten maps for Jedi Academy and translating Half-Life concepts into Sven-Coop.

Thus, a cycle has come to an end. The boy who got punched in the face for offering his hand has grown into a man who extends a helping hand to other creators. His GameBanana medals aren't just for 5 or 10 mods created, but also for the 5 thanks to other authors. His abandoned channels, the deleted Tribes fandom, the frozen game "UnderTale White"-these aren't failures, but milestones on a journey, bricks in the bridge he's building from loneliness to community.

TIPS:

- To clear the path, use an army knife or pistol.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy them remotely due to their modifiers.
- In a group, a sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective.
