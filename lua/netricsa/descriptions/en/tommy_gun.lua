DESCRIPTION:

The Thompson submachine gun (also known as the "Tommy Gun"), popularized in the 1930s by Al Capone and other gangsters, offers decent stopping power, reloads quickly, and is the island's go-to submachine gun. Less popular with officers than the revolver, it is nonetheless a common weapon. It is first found at the top of the stairs next to a small office in the WWII chronometer, where Tork recalls the Colonel yelling at a soldier.

NOTES:

- Fire in long and short bursts.
- Al Capone sends his regards.
