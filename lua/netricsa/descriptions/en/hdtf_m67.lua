DESCRIPTION:

The M67 is the standard U.S. "baseball" fragmentation grenade introduced in the late 1960s. Its spherical steel body contains a pre-notched fragmentation liner and about 6.5 oz (≈184 g) of Composition B explosive; on detonation the body fragments produce the lethal/shrapnel effect. The grenade is armed by removing the safety pin and releasing the safety lever (spoon), after which the M213 pyrotechnic fuze burns for roughly 4-5 seconds before detonation.

NOTES:

- Lethal radius commonly quoted ~5 m; casualty/effective radius ~15 m; small fragments can be projected hundreds of meters in rare cases.
- Average throw distance ≈30-35 m; be cautious with throw arcs in confined spaces to avoid friendly/self injury.
- Classified as an anti-personnel/area-effect munition - effective for clearing cover and suppressing infantry.
