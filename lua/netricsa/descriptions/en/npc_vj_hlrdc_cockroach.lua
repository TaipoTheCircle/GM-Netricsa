DESCRIPTION:

At first glance, the Cockroach looks like an ordinary Earth insect. But given its uncanny ability to survive explosions, radiation, toxic waste, and pretty much anything you throw at it, some theorists insist it must have Xen origins. After all, its flat body shape and twitchy antennae look suspiciously similar to a miniature manta or antlion grub.

Black Mesa personnel frequently spotted these critters scuttling through laboratories right after the resonance cascade. Coincidence? Or proof that the humble cockroach is actually a Xen scout species, here to test the durability of Earth`s food supply? We may never know.

TIPS:

- Harmless, but can make you miss a shotgun blast when it runs underfoot.
- Some scientists feed them, others scream - choose your side.
- If you can kill one, congratulations - youve done what a nuclear war cant.
