DESCRIPTION:

The Zombie Torso is the mutilated remains of a human host, animated by a headcrab even after losing most of its body. Often encountered crawling through wreckage or thrown aside in combat, these creatures drag themselves forward with surprising speed, shrieking in agony as the parasite drives them onward. Despite their pitiful state, they retain enough strength to claw at prey or attempt a bite. Their grotesque persistence makes them more disturbing than dangerous.

TIPS:

- A single well-placed hit is usually enough.
- Don't let them distract you during larger battles—they’re often used as "noise" alongside stronger zombies.
- Watch your footing in dark areas; they tend to crawl out of debris suddenly.
