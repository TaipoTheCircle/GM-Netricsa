DESCRIPTION:

The primary multi-role helicopter of the Krieger forces. Used for patrols, rapid reinforcement deployment, and close fire support. It has a standard camouflage pattern with the company logo.

The evil Stone Face has captured a Krieger mercenary UH-60 patrol helicopter. The Unpaid Moai's Wrath is at its height - this flying stone head is even more dangerous. It patrols key points across the archipelago, futilely demanding its wages, and attacks anyone in sight, be they mercenaries, Trigens, or Jack.

The Moai's head is built into the machine gunner's position, its stone mass serving as armor and structural reinforcement. The M134 turret on the left side is controlled by the idol's magical "sight," firing with monstrous accuracy and speed. It is the embodiment of ancient wrath fused with modern military technology.

TIPS:

- Avoid the M134's barrage of bullets, which pierces light cover and deals colossal damage.
