BLACK MESA,  SCIENTIST'S PROBLEM


Sam, visual scan ahead... oh, this doesn't look good. There's a scientist standing on what's left of a catwalk. And when I say "what's left", I mean three rusty bolts, a prayer, and a lot of gravity.

I've run the survival probability through all my models. Result: 1% chance he's going to make it. And that's only if a miracle happens - like a headcrab suddenly turning into a trampoline. Spoiler: not likely.

Be careful, because if you step too close, the vibrations might be enough to send him down into the abyss. On the other hand... if you don't step close, he's probably going to fall anyway. It's one of those classic lose-lose scenarios, except it's not you losing.

Strategic suggestion: don't waste too much ammo or effort here. If you try to save him and somehow succeed, congratulations - you've just beaten math. But I wouldn't bet my charming red sneakers on it.
