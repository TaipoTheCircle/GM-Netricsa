DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Civil Protection Interceptor is a specialized civil Protection unit, adapted for operations in snowy and arctic regions. These units are used to patrol icy cities, polar stations, and remote areas where standard CP forces lose mobility and orientation.

He wears a gray-and-white camouflage protective suit that blends in with the snowy landscape. The uniform is reinforced with belts, pouches, and equipment mounts designed for long, unattended operations in extreme cold. Black body armor protects the torso, and heavy black boots provide stability on ice and snow.

Their main distinguishing feature is a mask with two large, glowing blue lenses that serve as thermal imaging and night vision sensors. These lenses allow the Interceptor to detect targets through blizzards, fog, and snow curtains, turning poor visibility to their advantage.

They are armed with an SMG3 (HK MP7), a compact, rapid-fire weapon ideal for close- and medium-range combat in confined spaces. If necessary, the Interceptor can deploy the Manhack, using it for reconnaissance, pursuing fugitives, or air pressure.

Interceptors act quickly, rarely engage in protracted combat, and prefer tactics of pressure, encirclement, and finishing.

TIPS:

- Don't rely on cover in a snowstorm—its sensors are better than they appear.
- The Manhack is often used to disorient before an attack.
- The MP7 is deadly at close range due to its high rate of fire.
