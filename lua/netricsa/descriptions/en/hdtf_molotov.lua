MOLOTOV COCKTAIL


WEAPON: Molotov Cocktail (improvised incendiary)
AMMO:   Flammable solution
ROF:    ~6 throws/min (depends on user)

DESCRIPTION:

An improvised incendiary device - a bottle filled with flammable liquid and a fuse - used to ignite targets, create persistent fire zones and deny enemy movement. On impact the bottle breaks, igniting the spilled fuel and creating a burning area that deals damage over time and obstructs movement.

NOTES:

- Creates a burning patch with damage-over-time and potential to set nearby flammable objects alight.
- Good for softening or channeling groups, blocking chokepoints and destroying light cover; hazardous in confined spaces due to risk of self-damage.
- Single-use, limited supply; ineffective vs heavy armor and fire-resistant enemies.
