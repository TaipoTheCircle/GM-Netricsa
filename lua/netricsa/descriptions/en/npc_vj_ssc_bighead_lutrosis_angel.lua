DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Cool Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Where are you going!?" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Matt "Lutrosis" McGill is one of those unsung heroes whose work forms the foundation of the game's stability and polish. His oversized skull is a direct result of countless hours spent finding bugs, testing mechanics, and sending detailed reports to the Croteam developers. While others enjoyed the finished product, Lutrosis fought against Kleers falling through textures, stuck doors, and progress failures to prevent the same from happening to others.

His nickname in the credits is a sign of the studio's highest recognition. He embodies a dedicated community of fans who don't just play, but actively participate in the creation, transforming themselves from consumers into co-creators of quality.

He was once alive, but after you killed him in the Temple of Hatshepsut, he was resurrected - becoming an Angel.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy him remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
