DESCRIPTION:

When the Strogg needed a device capable of taking out both infantry and vehicles with equal effectiveness, they took a heavy infantryman and tore off his legs. They replaced them with an anti-gravity platform. The result is a Heavy Hover Tank—a flying fortress that doesn't run, but hovers.

The Guided Missile is the Heavy Hover Tank's primary attack. It's highly destructive, dealing heavy damage and knocking enemies back several dozen meters with explosive damage and sometimes fall damage.

In close combat, if some madman gets too close, the Tank will simply crush them with its hand.

TIPS:

- Only powerful weapons, such as the Rocket Launcher, Nail Gun, and Dark Matter Cannon, can cause serious damage to it.
- When fighting other enemies, the Heavy Hover Tank should be destroyed first, as it can inflict significant damage.
