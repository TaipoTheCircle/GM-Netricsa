DESCRIPTION:

Ugh-Zan "?", the Pitiful Sorcerer, is a gray, twisted four-armed abomination born from a failed cloning experiment of the legendary Ugh-Zan III. When there were no candidates for Ugh-zan yet. When Mental's scientists attempted to replicate the DNA of the great warlord, something went horribly wrong-the result was a malformed, unstable being with laughable power and endless bitterness. And since Mental did not know what to call him, he gave him a nickname in honor of his body shape "?".

Due to his pathetic strength and inability to regenerate, Mental stripped him of all honor and sealed him inside a display capsule within the Museum of Ugh-Zans, a living exhibit of failure. Yet, after centuries of humiliation, the Pitiful Sorcerer escaped his confinement, fueled by hatred and madness.

Now, obsessed with vengeance, he seeks to destroy "Serious" Sam Stone, the one who once gazed mockingly upon his glass prison.

Despite his weakness, Ugh-Zan "?" is not harmless-he can float, unleash volleys of feeble rockets, and summon small reinforcements in desperate attempts to prove his worth to his long-forgotten master.

TIPS:

- His rockets are weak but unpredictable-keep moving.
- Avoid getting surrounded by his summoned minions.
- Don't underestimate his rage-cornered, he may fight with surprising ferocity.
