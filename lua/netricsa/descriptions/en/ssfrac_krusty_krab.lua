THE KRUSTY KRAB BIG WORKERS


The Krusty Krab Big Workers are an organized group of naval conspirators disguised as ordinary staff at the Bikini Bottom diner. Their activities revolve around the constant cycle of deceiving, capturing, and transforming customers into the very things they once ate.

The restaurant's menu is constantly changing. The names of dishes are never repeated and are deliberately ambiguous: "Human Patty, Crab Patty, Strange Patty". The source of the ingredients is never specified, and the staff evades any questions. The ingredients of each "burger" are determined by the last customer who failed to pay or was lonely enough to disappear without witnesses.

At the helm of the organization stands Eugene Harold Krabs. His power in the establishment is absolute, and his motivation is simple: money. He has established a system whereby the price is never stated in advance. When the time comes to pay, the sum is unaffordable, and the customer automatically becomes the property of the establishment. The workers work in a coordinated and emotionless manner, like service personnel on a production line.

Caught customers and trespassers are placed in the restaurant's basement-a makeshift holding cell where the future "True Ingredients" are held. If a victim attempts to escape or steal the formula for the "Perfect Krabby Patty", the system reacts immediately. The workers seal off escape, use false exits, and force the fugitive into an industrial meat grinder. From there, there's no turning back.
