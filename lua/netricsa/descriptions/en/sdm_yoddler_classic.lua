LAND OF THE DAMNED


If the data extracted from the 'Book of Wisdom' is correct, this beautiful small village covered with snow is the hideout of Arc-Al-Magi, the guys who wrote the very same book and know where the Holy Grail is! We should find some evidence here about the possible location of this crucial artifact. There are a few things mentioned in the Book of Wisdom that I don't get. There is a whole chapter about Lava Caves, a mystical place where the rivers of boiling magma are constantly flowing, and there is also a tale of an Ice castle... It's just too confusing, I'll need more time to put some pieces together. But whatever we do, we must get the Grail before Mental. Or else...
