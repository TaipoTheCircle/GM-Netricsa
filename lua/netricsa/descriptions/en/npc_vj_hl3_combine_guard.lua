DESCRIPTION:

Combine United Guard soldiers are an elite transhuman infantry force, serving between Overwatch's regular forces and specialized strike units. Unlike standard Combine soldiers, Guardsmen retain a greater degree of physiological autonomy, but are subject to deeper psychological conditioning and selective implant enhancements.

Their primary role is to hold key positions, protect strategic assets, and escort high-value transports such as the APC Transporter and Combine Track. Guardsmen are the first to deploy and the last to leave the operational zone.

A Combined Guard soldier's equipment is heavier than standard equipment: reinforced armor, recoil stabilizers, and integrated vital signs monitoring systems. Their helmets and respirators distort their voices, giving them a cold, impersonal tone, devoid of emotion and individuality.

Guardsmen do not seek quick cleanups; their goal is suppression and holding, even if this requires a protracted battle.

TIPS:

- Don't engage them in a protracted battle – the guards have higher than average endurance.
_ Grenades and concentrated fire are the best way to break through their defenses.
