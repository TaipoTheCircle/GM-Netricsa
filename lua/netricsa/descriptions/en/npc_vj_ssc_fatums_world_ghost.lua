DESCRIPTION:

Ghosts of the World of Fatum are green, translucent creatures cloaked in long robes reminiscent of the robes of high sorcerers. Their homeland is the Cemeteries of Fatum—distorted necropolises where the line between life and death has long since lost its meaning. There, they served as guardians.

These creatures unconditionally serve Fatum. And since Doom acts in Mental's interests, the wraiths are formally considered part of his Horde, though they themselves display neither individuality nor hesitation.

In combat, the wraiths use molten energy bolts that resemble lava. They hurl these projectiles at medium range and attack with their claws at close range. Despite their ephemeral nature, their strikes inflict real physical and energy damage.

TIPS:

- Don't linger in open areas: lava projectiles are effective in a straight trajectory.
- Avoid close combat: their claws are dangerous even through armor.
