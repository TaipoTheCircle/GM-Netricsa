DESCRIPTION:

The juvenile stage of the Antaresian spider is larger, stronger, and more dangerous than its hatchling relatives. It has a developed exoskeleton that protects it from small arms fire, and more powerful jaws. Like the hatchling, it can climb walls and ceilings, setting ambushes. Retains the ability to spit acid (more powerful and with a longer range) and is also deadly in close combat. Often found in groups, he acts as a hybrid ranged/melee fighter, distracting and harassing enemies.

TIPS:

- A single accurate shot from a double-barreled shotgun or a powerful blow from a sledgehammer kills instantly.
- Two shots from a pump-action shotgun, assault rifle, or sniper rifle are effective. Acid balls can be shot down in mid-air.
- Use a flare gun, grenade launcher, or C4. In a pinch, use an SBC gun or minigun.
