DESCRIPTION:

The hatchling form of Antaresian Spiders - giant alien arachnids from the planet Antares Prime. An extremely weak opponent with a thin exoskeleton, but it compensates for its vulnerability with numbers and surprise. Most often hatches from noise-sensitive cocoons. They have the ability to crawl along walls and ceilings, attacking with poisoned acid from afar or clinging to their victims up close. Their acid balls can ricochet off surfaces. While they're not dangerous individually, a swarm of dozens of these spiders can quickly surround and exhaust even an experienced fighter.

TIPS:

- They can emerge from underfoot, from the ceiling, or burst out of their cocoons after a loud gunshot.
- At close range, they can be instantly crushed with your foot. This doesn't waste ammo and is quick.
- The shotgun is effective against groups.
- The sledgehammer kills in one hit, doesn't waste ammo, but leaves you vulnerable for the duration of the swing.
