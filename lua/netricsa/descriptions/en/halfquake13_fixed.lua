HALF-QUAKE SHOW, FALSE HOPE


Well.... SOMOS is dead.

The metal cooled. The sparks died. The applause, alas, did not follow.

And now you were in the teleporter, with the feeling that the ending was just around the corner. Freedom, denouement, moral... whatever usually happens at the end.

Error.

You're lying on a stone slab. Your arms and legs are immobilized, like exhibits in a museum of other people's suffering. Above you is a ceiling clearly designed by someone who hates horizontal surfaces. Ahead, a spike. Big. Convincing. With the philosophical intent of getting inside your head and getting to know me better.

The voice from the speakers thanks you. Politely. With the enthusiasm of a corporate HR department firing you forever.

"Thank you for dying".

Classic.

Somewhere beyond the walls, screams, gunshots, and strange endings can be heard. Mental's forces are clearing out the show. Contestants, staff, security—everything is tangled up in one big, very expensive episode.

And I'll go write my will in binary code... Thank you, Sam. Goodbye.
