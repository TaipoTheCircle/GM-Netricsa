DESCRIPTION:

The school's chief bully and one of Miss Circle "favorites", a childhood friend and boyfriend of ∆lice. Unlike regular students, he and ∆lice are not students of Paper School in the traditional sense, but rather its "special guests" or part of a hidden system. Recognizable by his long, ankle-length white hair, black horns, an "A+" grade in his hair, and a pencil in place of his right hand. His tongue is forked like a snake's. He wears a black shirt with a diamond symbol (identical to the symbol on the ∆lice). He is a sadistic, arrogant, and playful bully, devoid of empathy. He enjoys tormenting others and is capable of killing for fun. He clearly possesses enhanced durability and possibly other abilities (eating inedible objects like soap).

TIPS:

- He is a master of manipulation and traps.
- He is driven by boredom, sadism, and devotion to the ∆lice. Don't look for logic or pity in his actions.
