DESCRIPTION:

The classic .45 caliber pistol designed by John Browning, used as standard issue by the US military for over half a century. Known for reliability, powerful round, and resilience under dirt and adverse conditions. It's often a high-damage sidearm good for medium distances, especially versus lightly armored enemies.

NOTES:

- High stopping power from .45 ACP rounds; often one shot to head = kill.
- Strong recoil and slower rate of fire - needs skill to control.
- Limited magazine size (7 rounds) forces precise shots.
- Commonly used as a backup or "last resort" weapon in firefights.
