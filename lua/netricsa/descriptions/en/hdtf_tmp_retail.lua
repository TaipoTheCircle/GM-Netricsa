DESCRIPTION:

A compact Austrian machine-pistol designed by Friedrich Aigner and produced by Steyr Mannlicher in the 1990s. Built as a lightweight, ergonomic close-quarters weapon with polymer construction, threaded barrel for suppressor fitment and an optional shoulder stock to improve control. The TMP excels in mobile CQB roles where short, high-rate bursts are required.

NOTES:

- Very high cyclic rate favors short controlled bursts rather than sustained full auto.
- Effective engagement range ~100 m; a stock and optics noticeably improve practical accuracy.
- Lightweight, ergonomic platform that served as a foundation for later compact SMG designs.
