DESCRIPTION:

Cats are tameable neutral creatures in the Minecraft Overworld, most often found in jungles, villages, and witch huts. Once tamed, they become loyal companions and follow you around, periodically sitting, lying down, or curling up nearby.

Cats have an innate repellent instinct: creepers and phantoms avoid cats, making them not only decorative but also strategically useful. Cats come in a variety of colors, from black and orange to spotted and Siamese.

A tamed cat can bring gifts in the morning-feathers, rotten meat, thread, and other small items—leaving them near its sleeping owner.

TIPS:

- Use raw cod or salmon to tame.
- Keep cats near your base to protect against phantoms and creepers.
- Different cat colors can be collected and bred.
