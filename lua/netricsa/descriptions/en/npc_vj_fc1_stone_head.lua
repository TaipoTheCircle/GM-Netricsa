SIZE:       ~14,7 ft
ENDURANCE:  Extremely High

DESCRIPTION:

An ancient stone idol, Moai, brought to life through unknown circumstances and dwelling deep in the jungle. Its main motivation is three days' unpaid wages as a stonemason, which drives it into a state of rage. Despite his lack of arms, he somehow wields and fires two massive M4 assault rifles mounted to his sides. His primary attack is a crushing stomp with his massive head, causing a shockwave and toppling trees and boars. He possesses colossal durability.

TIPS:

- Heavy fire from two high-caliber M4s and a devastating stomp attack that causes ground shaking and stuns make him a dangerous opponent.
- Explosives (grenade launchers, C4) are effective against stone structures.
- Potentially, he could be "pacified" by finding and returning his treasure-his "unpaid wages." But you don't have it.
