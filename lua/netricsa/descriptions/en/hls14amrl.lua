XEN, ISLAND OF ENTRY


The portal tears open, and the world turns inside-out. For a split second, you glimpse chaos - Freeman sprinting up behind you, Shephard bursting from a side entrance and opening fire on him, muzzle flashes lost in the glow of interdimensional rift. Freeman dives after you, but... doesn't land with you.

Silence. You're alone. The island of Xen breathes beneath your feet, floating in the endless void.

Then the voice comes. Not spoken, not heard - implanted directly into your skull.

"IDIOT".

It's Nihilanth. No translator needed. His tone is venom wrapped in exhaustion, telepathic thunder that makes the very rock tremble. He knows who you are. He knows why you've come. And he does not approve.

Objective:

Secure the outer island. Expect heavy Xen resistance - the Nihilanth is not subtle about his displeasure.

Locate the portal. Only by activating the inner gate can you descend deeper into Xen's domain.

Be wary: Mental's creatures bleed into this dimension as well, their own portals clawing for space alongside the Xen rifts.

Energy readings spike in center of island. That's your way down.
