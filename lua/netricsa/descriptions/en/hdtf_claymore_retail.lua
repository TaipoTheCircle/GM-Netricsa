M18A1 CLAYMORE ANTI-PERSONNEL MINE


WEAPON: M18A1 Claymore (directional anti-personnel mine)
AMMO:   C-4 charge with 700 steel balls
ROF:    Single-use device
WEIGHT: 1.6 kg

DESCRIPTION:

A U.S. - designed directional anti-personnel mine developed in the 1950s and widely used for perimeter defense and ambushes. On detonation the charge projects ~700 steel balls forward, producing a sheet-like pattern of lethal fragments-more akin to a dense buckshot than random fragmentation. The device is deployed curved toward the expected enemy approach and uses a simple sighting frame for aiming; the casing is famously marked “FRONT TOWARD ENEMY”.

NOTES:

- Effectiveness: approx. 60° arc and effective out to ~50 m; highest lethality at close ranges (notable casualty probability within ~5-15 m, with injuries possible farther out). 
- Safety distances: US FM 20-32 prescribes standoff/safety guidelines (example safe distances: 250 m forward for friendly forces, 100 m to sides/rear - use when emplacing). 
- Limitations: single-use, hazard to noncombatants in populated areas, requires careful placement, camouflaging and sector calculation.
