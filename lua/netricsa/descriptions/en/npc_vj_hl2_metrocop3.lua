DESCRIPTION:

Civil Protection Recruiters are specialized Combine personnel responsible for replenishing the ranks of the occupation forces from the local population. Unlike regular patrolmen, their job is not suppression, but selection. They identify suitable candidates using fear, pressure, and promises of stability in exchange for loyalty.

Their distinguishing feature is their bright blue, glowing eyes. These eyes enhance the effect of psychological dominance and allow the recruiter to maintain uninterrupted eye contact during "explanatory conversations."

In combat situations, recruiters try to avoid direct confrontation, relying on the support of regular Metropolitan Police units. Their value lies not in their firepower, but in their ability to turn citizens into future Combine soldiers.

TIPS:

- Blue eyes are easily visible in the dark and reveal their position.
