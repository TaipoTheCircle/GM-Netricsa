DESCRIPTION:

He is the son of the red biomechanoid. After Sam killed the latter, the mechanosaur swore to kill our savior.

T-Mechs - A cigar-chomping, chicken-legged Tyrannosaurus rex. Heavily armored. Armed with two rocket launchers.

T-Mechs are the next-generation Biomechanoids - although not much is different in their combat role, it is the scientific advancements that are impressive. Previously, biomechanoids were genetically programmed robots whose weapons were connected directly to their nerval systems. They didn't truly think for themselves, it was basically their reflex. T-Mechs, however, are capable of semi-cohesive thoughts and decide themselves when they wish to attack. This knowledge can be used to improve many of Mental's old biomechanical models.

Like major biomechanoids, T-Mechs will fire two missiles against their targets. However, they are half-dinosaur, which makes them all the more intimidating. They even inspired Sirian directors to make a new film, "Primordial Park". It has been broken box office records ever since its release.

TIPS:

- Their missiles are amongst the most powerful you will encounter in Mental's Horde - avoid them or shoot them down.
