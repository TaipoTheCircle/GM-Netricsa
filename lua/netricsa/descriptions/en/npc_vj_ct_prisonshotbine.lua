DESCRIPTION:

These soldiers were once true US Navy SEALs, masters of surprise raids and rescue operations in the world's most dangerous zones.

They worked as a team capable of bypassing any security and eliminating a target behind enemy lines, sometimes risking their lives for a few minutes of strategic advantage.

Originally a close-quarters assault specialist, this soldier was responsible for clearing guarded corridors.

In the Combine, he received a blue suit and a red helmet visor, and the SPAS-12 shotgun became his signature weapon, guarding prisons like Nova Prospekt.

TIPS:

- Keep your distance - the shotgun is especially deadly in tight corridors.
