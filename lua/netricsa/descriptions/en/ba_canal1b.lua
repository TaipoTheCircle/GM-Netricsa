CANALS OF BLACK MESA, A PUZZLE WITH LEVERS AND A FIND


Well, Sam, you're lucky to have found him! Hydroplasmic pistol "Zap Gun". It's not the most formidable thing to look at, but it'll do against creatures like Xena. It sparks, buzzes, and hits accurately -in general, it's better than with bare hands.

Now, up. But not just like that, not by stairs. You have to figure out the levers of freight elevators. The system is old and creaky, as if it's about to fall apart. But it works-if you know where to pull it.


How to get:

Think with your head, or you'll become completely numb with my help. You need it because teleportation has affected your nervous and mental system a bit.

Come on, Sam, up is the only way. May the Zap Gun be with you!
