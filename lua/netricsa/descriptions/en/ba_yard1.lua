THE SURFACE OF BLACK MESA, H.E.C.U. TRUCK


Sam, listen carefully!

We are on the surface of Black Mesa - the air is fresh, but it's too early to relax.

On the one hand, there is silence - neither Zen's powers nor his Mentality are visible.

On the other hand, there's an oil painting right in front of you.:

The H.E.C.U. truck stands as a monument to its former might, with two turrets nearby - that's who the main irritant here is!

These iron fools are not asleep: they will detect movement and your day will become a little shorter.
