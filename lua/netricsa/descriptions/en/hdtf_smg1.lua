DESCRIPTION:

The HK MP7 is a compact PDW developed by Heckler & Koch in the late 1990s to replace pistols and submachine guns for vehicle crews and protective details. It fires specialized 4.6×30 mm high-velocity rounds designed to defeat modern soft body armor while keeping muzzle impulse low. The MP7 pairs compact dimensions with a folding/telescoping stock, fully ambidextrous controls and accessory rails for optics, lights and lasers.

NOTES:

- Low recoil and high cyclic rate make it controllable in full auto for close-quarters engagements.
- The 4.6×30 mm cartridge was optimized to penetrate soft armor at typical engagement ranges.
- Compact form factor suits vehicle crews, special forces and VIP protection roles.
- Supports a wide range of accessories and suppressors 
- Effective engagement range is roughly up to ~200 m; beyond that, performance falls behind full-size rifles.
