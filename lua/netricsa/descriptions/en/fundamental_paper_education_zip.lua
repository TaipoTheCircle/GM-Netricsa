DESCRIPTION:

A student at Paper School, one of the three bullies and Oliver's accomplice. She has two-toned hair (black and white) with the incorrect equation "2 + 2 = 8" written on it, symbolizing her disregard for the rules. She wears a white dress and a poncho covered in childish drawings, creating a chilling contrast to her cruel nature. Playful, deceptive, and sadistic, she enjoys bullying and deadly "jokes" (she was likely the one who wrote "EXIT" on the door of the ∆fox's room). She only shows kindness to her younger brother. She is Miss Circular's "favorite" and possesses clearly inhuman abilities.

TIPS:

- Her cunning and cruelty are masked by playfulness. She is a master of deadly pranks and traps.
