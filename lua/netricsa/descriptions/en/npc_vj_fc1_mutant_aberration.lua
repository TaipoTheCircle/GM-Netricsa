DESCRIPTION:

The most resilient version of the trigen primate. Completely hairless, with a deformed skull fused to the ribcage. Their forelimbs have evolved into gigantic sickle-shaped pincers, similar to those of a praying mantis. Despite being less agile than chimpanzees, they possess increased health and inflict devastating damage in close combat.

TIPS:

- Requires concentrated fire - due to their increased survivability, single shots are ineffective.
- Use explosives - the area of ​​effect compensates for their high speed.
- Don't let them get too close - even armor won't protect you from their claws.
