BLACK MESA, SURFACE ACCESS AGAIN


Finally, fresh air! You made it outside-though I doubt it's the kind of welcome party you were hoping for. The courtyard is littered with bodies: scientists, security staff, and even Mental's alien troops, all cut down by H.E.C.U. fire.

And just in case you thought about enjoying the view-don't. There are two automated turrets mounted on the rooftop, sweeping the area with the patience only machines can afford. Those things won't ask for ID before opening fire.

Summary of the situation:

The surface isn't safer, just louder.

H.E.C.U. has already secured this zone, but not for your benefit.

If you don't want to end up as part of the growing body count, you'll need to move fast, stay low, and treat every corner as a firing squad in disguise.
