DESCRIPTION:

The Combine H.E.V. Overwatch Soldier is direct proof that the Combine doesn't invent, they take. After capturing Black Mesa's technology, the H.E.V. suit's technology was redesigned. The result is a blue combat exosuit with Combine insignia, designed both to protect the wearer and to maximize combat effectiveness until their death.

The soldier's appearance resembles a scientist in a H.E.V. suit, but the resemblance is deceptive. The Combine views the soldier as an expendable, yet extremely dangerous, resource.

Armed with an OICW and AR2, these soldiers are capable of combat at any range, combining automatic fire with underbarrel grenades. They are often used in situations where standard Overwatch units suffer excessive losses and elite forces are still "redundant".

TIPS:

- The OICW makes him especially dangerous behind cover.
- High endurance doesn't mean invulnerability - explosives still work just as well.
