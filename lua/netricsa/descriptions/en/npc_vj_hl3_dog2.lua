DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Droid is the Combine's direct, yet twisted, response to the Resistance Dog. Inspired by the Rebels, Overwatch engineers redesigned it, removing the "redundant" improvisation and emotional component, transforming the idea into a perfectly calibrated combat machine.

Unlike the Dog, the Droid is perfectly proportioned: its body is symmetrical, its movements are measured, and its mechanics are devoid of any abrupt, "lively" gestures. Its head is turned in the opposite direction. Its exterior is painted a deep black with red and white accents, and the Combine logo is clearly visible on its body.

Its purpose is simple: to break, crush, and destroy. It can throw cars, rip turrets from their mounts, and breach fortifications with the same ease as the Dog, but it does so methodically and accurately.

The Droid is integrated into the Combine tactical network and often works in tandem with Overwatch soldiers, providing cover, clearing passages, or sowing panic among the enemy.

TIPS:

- Direct combat is highly discouraged - its armor can withstand enormous forces. - Use the environment: collapses, traps and powerful explosions.
