BINOCULARS


ITEM: Binoculars (optical device)
AMMO: None
OPTICS: Typical magnification 4×–10×+ / objective diameter 25–50 mm

DESCRIPTION:

An optical instrument composed of two parallel viewing tubes for binocular (two-eyed) observation; provides a stereoscopic image and magnifies distant objects. Used in civilian, sporting, astronomical, naval and military roles; some models include rangefinders, compasses, night vision or gyro-stabilization. 

NOTES:

- Key specs are magnification and objective diameter; “10×40” = 10× magnification and 40 mm objective. 
- Exit pupil = objective diameter ÷ magnification; important for low-light performance (typical useful exit pupil ≈4-7 mm depending on ambient light and viewer age). 
- Twilight factor = √(magnification × objective diameter) - a rough indicator for dusk performance (doesn’t replace quality anti-reflection coatings).
