THE FRONTIER WORLD OF XEN, TIME TO ESCAPE!


There you go, Sam. It worked.

The portal opened and, as expected, returned us to where it all began. The lands of Xen. Native landscapes, familiar chaos, and the feeling that the world is about to completely break free from its moorings.

War is raging all around. Many Mental troops. A lot. They fight Xen's forces, not really distinguishing who is native and who is transient. The air crackles with energy, space trembles, and reality tries not to look in that direction.

Rosenberg's voice comes from the portal. He calls you "Calhoun." He's wrong. But honestly, that's not our problem right now. The main thing is that he's there. And the portal is working. For now.

The bad news is something else. The portal is unstable. It's tearing, flickering, and acting as if it's about to give up on existence. We need to retreat. Yes, I know. It's not your style. You'd rather stay, sort this out, finish this off, and only then leave.

But there's no choice. If we don't step forward now, the passage could close. Forever. And then Xen will become a dead end again, not a corridor.

Where it leads is unknown.

When it closes is also unknown.

So act, Sam.

Retreat.

Sometimes the best blow is a step back.
