DESCRIPTION:

The Combine Elite Beta Soldier is the standard white Overwatch Combine Elite soldier, designed to suppress resistance and maintain order in any environment. Distinguished by their armor, which is entirely white with black accents for camouflage. Unlike other Elite soldiers, he has two red eyes built into his helmet and three vents in his respirator that filter air.

This soldier type is designed for medium and long range combat, combining accurate pulse rifle fire with the use of energy grenades to suppress cover. Augments enhance reaction time and endurance, allowing the soldier to withstand intense fire and fight in difficult conditions.

TIPS:

- Two red eyes make him highly visible in the dark, but also allow him to better react to player movement.
- Energy grenades can knock you out of cover and incinerate you – don't stand still.
- Stay behind cover and use long-range weapons to reduce the risk of close combat.
