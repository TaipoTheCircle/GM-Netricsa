DESCRIPTION:

The Civil Protection Rebel is a rare but valuable traitor from the Metropolitan Police. Unlike active CP operatives, he does not wear a respirator mask, which immediately distinguishes him from others and emphasizes his break with the Combine - both symbolic and practical. His face is open, and his voice is unfiltered. Many of them defect to the Resistance not out of heroism, but out of fatigue, fear, or a belated realization of their role in the oppressive system.

TIPS:

- Don't confuse him with enemy Metrocops—the lack of a mask is a key indicator.
- Effective in urban combat and sabotaging Combine installations.
- Works best in a group, providing cover for less-armed rebels.
- Vulnerable to heavy Overwatch units without support.
