DESCRIPTION:

"Painty", also known simply as BurgerBeard, is a cursed undead from Bikini Atoll. In life, he was the son of a stern pirate who dreamed of making him a true sea robber. However, BurgerBeard himself dreamed not of gold and boarding, but of creating the perfect burger.

His dreams made him a laughingstock at pirate school. The ridicule and humiliation drove him to madness. In an attempt to change his fate, Burger Beard stole a magic book from Bikini Atoll's skeletal guardian, intending to rewrite Bikini Bottom's history and obtain the secret formula for the Krabby Patty.

Having obtained his desire, he headed to dry land, where he began selling Krabby Patties from a Burgermobile. However, his plan was ruined after a protracted battle with SpongeBob and his friends, who had assumed the guises of superheroes. Plankton ultimately cast Burger Beard back to Bikini Atoll, where he was cursed.

Even in death, Burger Beard has not found peace. His skeleton still sings "who lives in a pineapple under the sea?" at the start of each day, unable to stop. He wears red, ragged pants and a red pirate bandana-the last vestiges of his unfulfilled dream of becoming more than just a pirate jester.

TIPS:

- Destroying the skeleton stops the singing.
- Some creatures dance to its song.
