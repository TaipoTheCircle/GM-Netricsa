DESCRIPTION:

Slimy Transfers are result of botched Stroggification attempts.

Slimy Transfers are covered in thick slime, behave similarly to classic zombies: they moan, puke acid over distance, and eat flesh. The acid does lingering damage, especially dangerous in tight spaces. 

Zombies are mostly found in the Waste Processing Facility. 

TIPS:

- Aim for the head or chest - headshots deal extra damage.
- Keep distance from Slimy Transfers to avoid acid puke.
