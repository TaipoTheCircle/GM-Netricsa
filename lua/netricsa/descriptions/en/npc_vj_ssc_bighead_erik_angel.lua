DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam's developers. They wear the Serious Sam uniform, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They exhibit an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Where are you going!?" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Erik Wolpaw is a living legend in the gaming industry, co-founder of the satirical website Old Man Murray (OMM), and one of the most renowned video game writers since Marc Laidlaw. Croteam, with their characteristic self-deprecating humor, immortalized him in the game as a cameo, awarding him the BIGGEST HEAD of all secret fans. His oversized cranium is a direct result of his enormous influence and sarcastic wit, which he first used to critique the industry through OMM and then to transform it as a writer at Valve.

He penned the dialogue and plot twists in hits like Portal (and his iconic song "Still Alive"), Portal 2, and Half-Life 2: Episode One and Episode Two.

When you killed him twice in Ancient Egypt, he transformed into an Angel.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, eliminate them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
