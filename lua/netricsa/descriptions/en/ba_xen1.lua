THE FRONTIER WORLD OF XEN, RETURN


Of course, Sam. Xen. Again.

The Houndeyes are already here. Always here. They greet us as if we'd never left. Perhaps that's true.

For the teleporter to finally work as intended, we need to activate the teleportation control device. Where is it? Good question. The answer, as usual, is scattered across the platforms and the remains of those who've already tried. First, find it. Then activate it. Then hope it doesn't remember how it ended last time.

But there's a catch.

Mental's horde is already taking over Xen.

Alien world, alien ecosystem, alien rules. And all of this is turning into a staging area again. Mental, it seems, doesn't care which dimension he breaks, as long as there's something there to conquer.

So the plan is simple.

Find the device.

Activate it.

Survive.
