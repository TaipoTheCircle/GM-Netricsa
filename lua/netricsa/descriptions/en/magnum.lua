ROF:    40 rpm

DESCRIPTION:

The Smith & Wesson Model 28 Highway Patrolman revolver is the standard service sidearm for police officers in Abbott and many other Maryland law enforcement agencies. It fires .357 Magnum cartridges and holds six rounds. This is an extremely deadly weapon. Those skilled in the use of such a weapon can be much more dangerous with two of them. Since firearms regulations in Abbott are quite lax, these revolvers are found in abundance wherever police officers keep them. Ammunition is also quite easy to obtain. The first can be obtained from the senior officer, either by killing him as he emerges from the restroom or by allowing him to die in the electric chair in the electrocuted room. The second revolver, for dual use, can be found in Chapter 2, "Descent," after encountering the island's three ghosts and becoming familiar with madness and the creature, but before encountering the first snipers who execute the tied-up officer. Pull the lever to detonate the generator in the flooded room you pass, and the second revolver can be found hidden in the wall behind it.

NOTES:

- Target-oriented revolver - excellent for precision shooting.

- "Stand still, or die! Do you understand me?"
