DESCRIPTION:

A terrifying product of Mental's accidental genetic experiment, created under the influence of strange 20th-century artifacts. Upon awakening, even its creator was shocked by this insatiable, frightening beast. However, the experiment continued. Inspired by the success (if you can call it that) of shrinking the Sirian bulls, Mental continued experimenting with size. Now you can encounter miniature Cucurbitos. The smaller versions retain the same dull aggression and are armed with tiny, but no less deadly, chainsaws. They are dangerous in packs and can attack from hiding places, such as pumpkins.

TIPS:

- Very dumb, but if caught, extremely dangerous.
- Move out of the attack's line of fire.
- Area-of-effect weapons are effective against miniature versions.
- Beware of swarms of miniature Cucurbitos—they can suddenly emerge from Trojan Jack-o'-lanterns.
