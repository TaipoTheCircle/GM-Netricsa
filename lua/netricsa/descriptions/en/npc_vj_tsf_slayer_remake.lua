DESCRIPTION:

The Slayer is one of the most iconic and terrifying enemies on the island. Created as a representation of execution by beheading, its body is gruesomely melded: its head is detached and held above its body by flesh and steel apparati, while its limbs have transformed into long, lethal blades. 

Slayers move with unnatural agility, able to skulk along walls and ceilings, drop down on victims, or slash at them from “above.” They are often heard before seen - their blade-limbs scrape and whisper, giving away their approach.

TIPS:

- Always aim to destroy the head - slayers lose awareness without it.
- Keep moving - standing still invites their ambush.
- Listen carefully - their blades on walls and ceilings often warn you before they strike.
