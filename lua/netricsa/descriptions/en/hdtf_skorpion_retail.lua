DESCRIPTION:

The Skorpion vz. 61 is a compact Czechoslovak machine-pistol developed for officers, vehicle crews and security personnel. Its folding stock and pocketable size made it ideal as a concealable PDW/backup weapon. Chambered originally for the low-power .32 ACP cartridge, it relies on high cyclic rate and controllable burst mechanics (rate reducer) to deliver effective close-range fire.

NOTES:

- Suited for CQB and close self-defense - small, concealable and quick to deploy.
- Low per-shot power is offset by volume of fire; best used in short bursts for controllability.
