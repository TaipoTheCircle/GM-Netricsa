DESCRIPTION:

A unique Jumper mutation, created after accidentally falling into the sewers of Krieger's laboratory. Instead of degradation, the mutagen and the former soldier's engineering knowledge merged, creating the Squeaker Plumber. He wears a blue uniform tucked into his pants with a distinctive "M" insignia on his cap, which has somehow survived the mutation. His hypertrophied limbs are now perfectly adapted for hydraulically enhanced super-jumps, allowing him to soar to enormous heights and land with a devastating impact.

TIPS:

- Don't tell the Red Japanese Company about this.
