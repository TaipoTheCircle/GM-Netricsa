GONZO GUN


WEAPON: Gonzo Gun
AMMO:   Eggs
ROF:    Rapid Single Shots

DESCRIPTION:

The Gonzo Gun is a secret weapon found fairly late in the game and also unlocked with built-in cheats in the "The Suffering: Ties That Bind" expansion. The Gonzo Gun literally resembles a chicken. It has the same ammo as the dual revolvers and, surprisingly, fires eggs that will completely destroy any non-Captain villain. It's a powerful weapon, but its appearance and operation are terrifying. Location: Torque can find it in the basement. Starting from the secluded section in the northeast, moving west and then south into the hallway leading to the southern secluded area, he can drag the large metal crate (blocking the southern door) into the narrow end of the hallway. Once the crate is in the right place, Torque can use it to climb onto it. From the top of the crate, you can climb to a spot in the broken stone wall. This appears to be a hiding place for guards to smoke, as a dead guard is sitting on a chair, with a lit cigarette, a pack of cigarettes, and a Zippo lighter in an ashtray on the floor next to him. The contraband also contains useful items such as ammo, as well as a Gonzo Pistol. What the guard was doing with the chicken, which releases deadly eggs when pressed, remains a mystery. This room is accessible during Torque's first visit to the basement (at the beginning of the game), but the Gonzo Pistol is not there. (Visiting this room before reaching the surface may make the Gonzo Pistol unavailable later.) - Fun fact: The "Gonzo Gun" is named after the Muppets' recurring character Gonzo, who has a running gag throughout the series about falling in love with chickens.

NOTES:

- Each shot consumes one egg; ammo is limited.
- Kills non-boss enemies in one shot; generally ineffective against final bosses.
- Best used sparingly on high-value targets or for clearing out particularly dangerous encounters.
