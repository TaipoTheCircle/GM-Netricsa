HALF-QUAKE SHOW, THE PATH TO SOMOS


Oh. Now it's getting really serious.

At the end of this circus of platforms and holes in reality, a teleporter awaits you. Not just an exit. Not just the next level of pain.

But an audience with the owner of pain.

And his name is SOMOS. Son of the Masters of Sadism.

This isn't a man, Sam. This is a machine. A torture algorithm with delusions of grandeur. The central conductor of the show, deciding where you jump, where you fall, and where the audience should applaud.

Your task sounds almost romantic:

break through the parkour swarming with Mental's horde, find the portal, enter the space of the flying platforms, press all those cute buttons, activate the main portal, and personally explain to SOMOS that machines also have fatal design flaws. Usually in the head.

The Sadists and Mental are clearly nervously smoking on the sidelines right now.

So go ahead, Sam.

Go meet the "Son of the Masters of Sadism".

I have a feeling he's never met a true master of system destruction.
