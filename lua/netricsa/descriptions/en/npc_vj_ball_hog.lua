DESCRIPTION:

The Ball Pig is a Badnik robot created by the evil Dr. Eggman as part of his machine army. Its design resembles a pig-like mechanical organism with a rounded body, standing on two mechanical legs and armed with a device built directly into its belly. It's through this circular armor that it fires metallic ball bombs that bounce and damage targets.

Its attack method is simple but effective in narrow corridors and on inclines: the Ball Pig often climbs higher on slopes or at the edge of platforms and drops its bombs down, where they bounce along the ground and twist, creating a deadly trap for anyone trying to pass by.

Despite its appearance, inspired by a real pig, it's a cold war machine. It was among the early Badnik models used during the first Eggman invasions, and it still appears in various worlds today.

TIPS:

- It's best to attack it from a distance or from above.
- The bombs bounce—anticipate their trajectory and dodge.
- When destroyed, the Ball Pig often releases an animal hostage, like other Badniks.
