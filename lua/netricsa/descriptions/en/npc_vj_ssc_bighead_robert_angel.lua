DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam developers. They wear the uniform of Serious Sam, but have the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Where are you going!?" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, they gain fire and ice modifiers. They appear spontaneously in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Robert Westmoreland is the "invisible" strategist behind the business success of this madness. His oversized cranium is a treasure trove of market wisdom, gleaned over decades of his career, from a buyer at Walmart to the CEO of publishing divisions. While the Croteam developers were creating digital worlds, Robert was handling an equally challenging task: business development. He was the man who helped find publishers, build partnerships, and ensure that "Serious Sam" not only existed as a cult classic, but also as a commercially viable product reaching players worldwide.

His influence can be traced from the very first The First Encounter to the HD remasters and Classics: Revolution.

He was once alive, but after someone killed him, he was resurrected - becoming an Angel.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, destroy them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
