DESCRIPTION:

The Remington Model 700 is one of the world's most widespread bolt-action rifles, produced since 1962. Renowned for accuracy and reliability, the platform is used by hunters, competitive shooters, police marksmen and military units (in modified forms). Its design is highly modular - easy to change stocks, barrels, add bipods, optics and upgrade triggers - which makes the 700 a popular foundation for dedicated sniper / anti-materiel builds.

NOTES:

- Factory and competition models show tight groups; with proper bedding and tuning the 700 is a precise platform.
- Concerns: historical litigation and debate over factory trigger mechanisms (some early batches reported unsafe / over-sensitive triggers); many users fit aftermarket triggers for consistent performance.
