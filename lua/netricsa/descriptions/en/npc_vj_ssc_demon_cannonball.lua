DESCRIPTION:

Another hideous mutation, courtesy of Notorius Mental. A simple lizard-like organism from Fíendia Prime was crossbred and mutated through several generations, and was finally reinforced with a titanium skeleton. It has a unique ability of forming a miniature black hole through which it can summon Cannonballs into existence. Weak magical forces will hold this Uranium-filled projectile coherent for a short period of time. As it hits the ground, it will detonate and finally explode.

TIPS:

- Avoid the Cannonballs at all costs!
- Cannonballs are slower when your farther away so keep your distance.
