BLACK MESA DEVTEST, GLASS BREAK


Instead of a normal exit, the is funneled into smashing through the observation glass - a very direct, very theatrical solution.

On the other side, there's no natural transition: just a glowing portal stub, deliberately placed to fast-forward the demo. Stepping through drops you straight into the corridor where a scientist bangs on a door, begging a guard to let him in. This is also where the H.E.C.U. soldiers make their first appearance in the demo, storming the complex for maximum dramatic effect.
