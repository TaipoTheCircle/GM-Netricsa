DESCRIPTION:

Big-Heads are thin humanoids with exaggerated skulls containing the brains of Croteam's developers. They wear the Serious Sam uniform, but with the unique facial features of the development team. They display an obsessive enthusiasm, chasing you with cries of "Hello!" and "Hey, Wait!" They are completely harmless, but in the "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty level they gain fire and ice modifiers. They spontaneously appear in secret areas, blocking passages with their sheer numbers.

Damjan Mravunac is the man whose music is the soundtrack to the chaos in the Serious Sam universe. His oversized skull is a direct result of his incredible musical talent, encompassing everything from epic orchestral arrangements to thunderous heavy metal riffs. A Croteam composer since 1999, Damjan is the architect of that "serious" sound that immerses everyone in the atmosphere of frantic action from the very first notes.

His style is a unique cocktail of powerful percussion, catchy melodies, ethnic motifs, and modern electronica. He doesn't just compose background music; he creates soundscapes that have become an integral part of gameplay. From the iconic themes of The First Encounter to the orchestral sweep of The Talos Principle 2, his work is as much a hallmark of the studio as Sam Stone himself.

He was once alive, but after you killed him in the Temple of Hatshepsut, he rose from the dead – becoming a demonic Zombie.

TIPS:

- Use a combat knife or pistol to clear the path.
- On "I Am Ugh-Zan" difficulty, eliminate them remotely due to their modifiers.
- A sledgehammer with a horizontal strike is effective in a group.
