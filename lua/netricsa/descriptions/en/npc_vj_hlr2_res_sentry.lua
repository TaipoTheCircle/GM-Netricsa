DESCRIPTION:

The Rebel-Hacked turret is a standard Combine man-portable turret, captured, crudely recoded, and reintroduced by Resistance forces. Its exterior features a modified paint job and signs of field repair, but its deadly internals remain the same.

After the reprogramming, the target recognition system no longer considers Combine fighters as "friends." Now, any Metrocop or Overwatch soldier is automatically designated as a priority target. The turret immediately opens fire upon detecting enemy movement or heat signature.

Rebels actively use these turrets to defend cover, underground bases, corridors, and choke points. Thanks to its compact size and high firepower, a single turret can hold a position that would otherwise require an entire squad.

Despite the change of allegiance, the turret remains an Combine machine by nature. It doesn't discriminate between tactics, doesn't conserve ammo, and knows no fear. The only thing that has changed is the target list.

TIPS:

- Place turrets in choke points and on the flanks - that's where they're most effective.
- Watch the line of fire - the turret doesn't discriminate between allies if they get between it and the target.
