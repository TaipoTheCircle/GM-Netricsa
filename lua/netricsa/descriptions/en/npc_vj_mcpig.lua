DESCRIPTION:

Pigs are peaceful mammals that inhabit plains, forests, and other Minecraft biomes. They graze on grass, do not attack, and are often found in groups of 2-4.

Use a carrot on a stick to control their movement, and breed them using carrots, potatoes, or beets.

Pigs are an important source of pork and leather, making them valuable for food and crafting.

TIPS:

- Use a carrot on a stick to control a pig on a saddle.
- Breeding pigs is convenient for creating a constant source of food and materials.
