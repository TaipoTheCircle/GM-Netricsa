DESCRIPTION:

The Strogg IRON MAIDEN is a flying combat unit of the Strogg army, a semi-living cybernetic creature with an upper body resembling a female figure and floating energy ribbons in place of legs, allowing it to hover in the air.

She is equipped with a powerful rocket launcher on her left arm and can fire a series of rockets with a significant blast radius. Her high maneuverability and ability to briefly teleport allow her to evade direct attacks, making her a dangerous opponent at medium and long range.

At close range, Iron Maiden uses a short-duration super-tonal energy scream that not only deals damage but also disorients the target. In extreme cases, she can attack with her "claw"-a mechanical melee claw.

TIPS:

- Due to the rocket's blast radius, avoid open spaces and stay behind cover.
- Iron Maiden can teleport and dodge.
- Her super-tonal melee scream disorients the target-keep your distance.
