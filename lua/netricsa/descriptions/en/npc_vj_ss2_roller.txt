DESCRIPTION:

It is unknown why Mental constructed these gigantic rolling balls. Some speculate that they were designed for mountainous combat, so that they roll down from above and crush the attackers. Others speculate they may have been toys for Mental's pet hamster. No one is certain about their origins.

However, what everyone agrees on is that they are very annoying to deal with. Roller Drones will, as you might have guessed, try and roll over you. They are very speedy and can manuever over any kind of terrain. Try to make them a priority target.

TIPS:

- Dodge their charges by side-stepping.
- Shooting them will slow their momentum, and might even push them back.
