DESCRIPTION:

The Glock 17 pistol is an Austrian pistol developed by Glock for the Austrian Armed Forces. The Glock 17 was the first weapon developed by this company. The resulting model proved to be quite successful and convenient to use, thanks to which it was later adopted by the Austrian Armed Forces under the designation P80. Due to its combat qualities and reliability, it has become widely used as a civilian self-defense weapon. Glock produces modifications of this pistol in various versions for different cartridges, for example: 9×19 mm Parabellum Glock 19, .40 S&W - Glock 22, 10 mm Auto - Glock 20, .357 SIG - Glock 31, .45 ACP - Glock 36, and .45 GAP - Glock 37. A distinctive feature of the pistol's design is the absence of a safety catch and trigger. The pistol is mostly made of high-strength heat-resistant plastic (up to 200 °C). This makes the Glock 17 lightweight and extremely durable. The principle of operation is "pull and shoot"; the safety is hidden in the trigger, which means that the shot will not be fired unless the "safe action" trigger is fully depressed. It consists of 33 parts and can be partially disassembled in seconds. It is mainly used by law enforcement agencies in various NATO countries, including the United States, and is also very popular among civilians as a weapon for self-defense or recreational shooting.

NOTES:

- The most widely used weapon for self-defense in the world.
- Its simple design allows even the most inexperienced shooters to use this weapon.
- It has become popular in US street culture.
