DESCRIPTION:

The Snow Golem is a passive, constructed mob created by a player or dispensary by placing two snow blocks with a carved pumpkin on top. It throws snowballs at nearby hostile mobs, attracting and repelling them, but snowballs rarely deal direct damage, with the exception of Blazes.

The Snow Golem won't attack allies, but it reacts calmly to aggression from other creatures, pushing them with snowballs from up to 10 blocks away. When moving, it leaves a trail of snow layers if the climate and world rules allow. It is also vulnerable in humid or warm biomes-water, rain, and high temperatures will damage or slowly kill it.

If you cut off its pumpkin "head", it will drop the pumpkin, revealing its face underneath.

TIPS:

- The Snow Golem is excellent as a distracting guard, especially when combined with Iron Golems.
- The snow it leaves behind can be used to create a snow farm.
- Keep in mind that it melts in hot biomes, making it less suitable for defense there.
