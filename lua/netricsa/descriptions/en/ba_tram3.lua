BLACK MESA, MEETING WITH "OTIS"


Hey, look, the Otis is waving ahead. Just don't be in a hurry to be happy: It's not him. Another Generick‑The actor tried on someone else's disguise. And, apparently, while the real Otis is stuffing his belly in the cafeteria, this doppelganger should play the role of a friendly colleague.

Remember, the Generics are masters of disguise. They can pretend to be anyone: a scientist, a security guard, or even an object at all - a book on the table or a banana peel at the entrance. Motives? Unclear.

This "Otis" is smiling, calling you by your first name - "Barney Calhoun". It sounds like you're supposed to be on this train. The only question is: where was the real Barney going? And why he took his place... Well, let's say you? Although a similar situation with a Theoretical Physicist no longer surprises me.

The train is moving quietly, tunnels are flashing outside the window. There's a security area ahead. Where it all started last time. Somewhere out there, another Sam is already heading to the test chamber, or maybe he hasn't figured it out yet. Disaster is coming soon. But for now... For now, you're just a passenger. Almost.

Keep your eyes open. If Zhenya talks to you, it means that he needs something. Or he's just checking how well you're playing the role of "one of your own."

Go ahead, "Barney". The security area is already close. And there will definitely be no time for masks.
